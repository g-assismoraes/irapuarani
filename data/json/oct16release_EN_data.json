The southern border of our country is porous and millions of individuals from around the world have descended on our country.\n\nThese 'undocumented migrants' include terrorists, drug dealers, and intelligence agents of countries such as our enemy, China. It should alarm every American that 22,233 Chinese nationals have illegally entered the United States since the beginning of the fiscal year in October. If this rate continues, this year’s total will easily top the 24,125 Chinese nationals who illegally entered the country last year.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nThere has been an astounding 6,300% increase in the number of Chinese nationals illegally entering the country in the last few years. Since China is a communist nation, these individuals are not freely traveling to the United States for a 'better life.' U.S. Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) believes the influx is due to 'the direction of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party)' and it involves 'espionage' as well as 'stealing military and economic secrets.'\n\nLast year, China sent a spy balloon over our country, and it was not shot down until it completed its trek across many states. In addition, Chinese investors are buying American farmland for nefarious reasons, and it was confirmed that China operated 'police stations' in the United States to monitor their citizens in our country.\n\nChina is constantly threatening Taiwan and its other neighbors while building up its military forces. Their proxy state, North Korea, has started regularly testing long-range ballistic missiles that concern their neighboring countries.\n\nUkraine is in the third year of a bitter war with Russia. Last year, a United States report estimated that the total number of injuries and deaths in the war neared 500,000. There is no end in sight to the war as no peace talks are planned and the United States Congress is on the verge of allocating more military aid to Ukraine.\n\nOn October 7, Israel was invaded by Hamas resulting in the death of 1,200 innocent people. It was the deadliest attack on Israel since its founding in 1948. Hamas abducted over 240 hostages and 129 have not been returned home. These hostages either remain in captivity or are already deceased.\n\nAs Israel has responded to the Hamas invasion by sending military forces into Gaza, many Democrats have been critical. Sadly, innocent civilians have been killed in the conflict, but how can a nation survive with a terrorist organization operating on its border?\n\nTo further strengthen their security, on April 1, Israel bombed the Iranian embassy in Damascus, Syria. Among the seven officials killed in the airstrike were Iranian Brig. Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who helped plan the October 7 massacre in Israel.\n\nTo retaliate for this strike, Iran launched over 300 drones and missiles into Israel on Saturday. Fortunately, almost all the strikes were intercepted by Israeli forces, with help from the United States, Jordan, and other countries.\n\nAs the world waits to see if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will respond to this attack, the Iranians are continuing to issue threats. In an interview on their state TV network, Iranian Major General Mohammad Bagheri said, 'Our response will be much larger than tonight’s military action if Israel retaliates against Iran.'\n\nIt is being widely reported by Axios, CNN, and other media outlets that President Joe Biden is urging Netanyahu not to respond and, if he does, the United States will not be involved. This response is disturbing to U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), who believes the world is witnessing the most dangerous period for the Middle East since 1973. He said, 'What I don’t understand is why Joe Biden and the administration would leak to the media the contents of a conversation in which he tells Netanyahu he doesn’t think that Netanyahu should respond at all. It is the continuing part of the public game they are playing which frankly encourages Iran and Hezbollah.'\n\nBiden has also encouraged Iran by relaxing our economic sanctions, which allowed additional oil revenue to flow into their coffers. This led to their renewed financial support for terrorist organizations like Hamas. Without Iran’s generous backing, Hamas would not have been able to launch their deadly October 7 attack against Israel.\n\nNot content to allow Iran to prosper from oil sales, Biden also released $16 billion in funds for Iran, partially for the return of six American hostages. Terror regimes should never be rewarded for taking hostages, but this is exactly what happened by the Biden administration’s unwise decision.\n\nAs the world deals with multiple international wars and unprecedented chaos in the Middle East, it is useful to remember what was happening when Donald Trump was our President.\n\nRead More @ TheLibertyDaily.com", "domain": "", "labels": {"narrative": ["Other"], "subnarrative": ["Other"]}}, {"article_id": "EN_UA_103667.txt", "content": "Desperation and Diplomacy: North Korea's Tech Hunt in Russia Amid Sanctions \n\n For several decades, North Korea has masterfully balanced its relations with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Russia, maintaining a relationship with the latter that is both complex and ever-changing.\n\nThe dynamics have shifted notably since Russia found itself sanctioned and isolated by the international community following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nSince then, North Korea and Russia have grown increasingly close, as recently seen when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited eastern Russia, where he held a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week.\n\nAfter a six-day visit, Mr. Kim returned to Pyongyang on Sunday.\n\nSanctioned by the international community, North Korea desperately needs Russian technology for nuclear weapons, satellite development, and food production.\n\nSimilarly, Russia, also facing sanctions, urgently seeks to replenish its dwindling front-line supplies with large quantities of ammunition from North Korea.\n\nBefore the summit, when asked whether Russia would assist North Korea in developing artificial satellites, Mr. Putin confirmed this was a primary reason for their meeting.\n\nBoth sides appear willing to overlook the threat of escalated international sanctions against them.\n\nDuring their summit, Mr. Kim vowed to 'fully and unconditionally support' Moscow.\n\nRocket technology holds particular interest for Mr. Kim and his regime.\n\nFrom Outward Support to Clandestine CyberattacksAccording to reports, North Korea has long eyed Russian technology, resorting to cyber theft to obtain it, and it is something that Moscow now appears ready to overlook despite recent reports such as one by Microsoft’s Threat Analysis Center (MTAC).\n\nThe MTAC report indicates that between March last year and this March, North Korean cyber operatives launched attacks on Russian aerospace research facilities and penetrated academic institutions engaged in research. Additionally, the operatives sent phishing emails to personnel within Russian diplomatic agencies.\n\nThe study further revealed that the countries most frequently targeted by North Korean cyberattacks during the same period included South Korea, Israel, Germany, and Russia.\n\nThe hacking groups, identified as ScarCruft and Lazarus, covertly installed digital backdoors within the company’s systems to exfiltrate sensitive information. While the full extent of the hackers’ achievements remains unclear, North Korea announced significant advancements in its ballistic missile program mere months after the cyber-attacks were initiated.\n\nSPUTNIX, a private enterprise affiliated with the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Space Research Institute, lost a substantial amount of information to these cyber incursions. The report speculates that North Korea may have stolen critical technology related to the design of ultra-small satellite bodies.\n\nExperts suggest North Korea’s successful launches of rockets equipped with reconnaissance satellites this year likely capitalized on its prior hacking exploits. These cyber activities appear crucial in advancing the country’s space technology.\n\nAdditionally, the report disclosed that in 2020, North Korean hackers penetrated the internal network of Russia’s Almaz-Antey, a leading manufacturer of surface-to-air missiles. The intruders pilfered various information, including developer personal data and proprietary details on missile components.\n\nIn 2019, North Korean cyber operatives also exfiltrated design blueprints from Russia’s Uralvagonzavod tank factory, the entity responsible for producing Russia’s next-generation T-14 Armata battle tank.\n\nMoreover, the report highlighted the frequency of North Korean cyber-attacks against Russian defense corporations specializing in avant-garde weapon systems like hypersonic technologies and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).\n\nMilitary commentator Xia Loshan told The Epoch Times on Sept. 10 that both North Korea and Russia are in a desperate situation.\n\n'While North Korea is eager to acquire military technology, the ultimate decision is not in their hands,' Mr. Xia stated, emphasizing that the alliance is precarious and likely unsustainable in the face of stringent international sanctions.\n\nIndependent analyst Zhuge Mingyang also weighed in.\n\n'In a relationship marked more by utilitarian needs than genuine alliance, both nations recognize the other’s motivations,' he told The Epoch Times.\n\n'Moscow likely knows full well that Pyongyang is siphoning off its military technology but seems willing to turn a blind eye in exchange for much-needed ammunition—a clear example of a ‘friendship’ based on mutual expediency.'", "domain": "", "labels": {"narrative": ["Other"], "subnarrative": ["Other"]}}, {"article_id": "EN_UA_021270.txt", "content": "Ukraine's Fate Will Be Decided In Coming Year, Top Zelensky Aide Admits \n\n Ukraine's Fate Will Be Decided In Coming Year, Top Zelensky Aide Admits\n\nIn surprisingly blunt words, a top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that the coming year will essentially decide the fate of Ukraine and its war with Russia.\n\n'A turning point in the war is approaching,' Andrii Yermak, who serves as chief of staff for the Office of the President of Ukraine, said Monday. 'The next year will be decisive in this regard.' He issued the words while appealing for more urgent aid from Washington in an address to the hawkish DC-based Hudson Institute think tank.\n\nYermak sought to assure the audience that Zelensky has 'a clear plan' forward even as Western media has by and large soured on Kiev's prospects for success. Much of this is about Zelensky sending envoys to do damage control in Washington at a moment the US administration's focus is off Ukraine and on Gaza events instead.\n\nHe described advancing plans for 'the development of our defense industry, and the deploying of our own arms production. But [that] will be later.'\n\nBut he quickly pivoted to an immediate need for more 'weapons right now'--describing that 'Russia still has air superiority. It is still capable of producing missiles, doing evasion of sanctions…And we especially need air defense systems.'\n\nWithout doubt, the Zelensky admin is in damage control after eyebrow-raising comments were issued to The Economist early this month by Ukraine's top commander, who admitted there will be no breakthrough and the battlefield situation is in a stalemate. The New York Times had characterized his remarks as 'the first time a top Ukrainian commander said the fighting had reached an impasse.'\n\nSo now Zelensky appears to be dispatching his envoys to calm Washington jitters over all the 'bad news' of late out of Ukraine.\n\nYermak also sought to assure the Hudson Institute conference that more billions given to Ukraine won't be 'charity' but is instead an 'investment' in America's 'global leadership.'\n\nHe further emphasized Zelensky's continued rejection of ceasefire talks with Russia, unless it's purely on Kiev's terms. 'We seek peace, but not just any peace. In our case, ending the war through compromise is nothing more than pausing it. Ukraine will not repeat the mistake of Minsk,' Yermak said.\n\nWatch the full Hudson Institute speech below:", "domain": "URW", "labels": {"narrative": ["Speculating war outcomes", "Discrediting Ukraine", "Discrediting the West, Diplomacy", "Praise of Russia", "Discrediting the West, Diplomacy"], "subnarrative": ["Other", "Situation in Ukraine is hopeless", "West is tired of Ukraine", "Praise of Russian military might", "The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests"]}}, {"article_id": "EN_UA_103403.txt", "content": "Russia Stages Major Airstrike on Ukraine; One Missile Enters Polish Airspace \n\n KYIV—Russia struck critical infrastructure in Ukraine’s western region of Lviv with missiles early on March 24, Kyiv said, in a major airstrike that saw one Russian cruise missile briefly fly into Polish airspace, according to Warsaw.\n\nMoscow launched 57 missiles and drones in the attack that also targeted Kyiv, two days after the largest aerial bombardment of Ukraine’s energy system in more than two years of full-scale war, Kyiv said.\n\n'There were two preliminary hits on the same critical infrastructure facility that the occupiers targeted at night,' Lviv’s regional governor, Maksym Kozytskyi, wrote on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nThe strike used Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, which are harder to shoot down, he added, without identifying the facility.\n\nThe energy ministry said equipment caught fire when a critical energy facility in the Lviv region was attacked, causing it to lose power.

However, the country’s water resources are depleting with the passage of time. It is feared that the entire world will face an acute water shortage in the coming years. Saiqa Imran, the deputy director of the Pakistan Council of Research and Water Reservoirs (PCRWR), told WealthPK that the country was feared to face an acute shortage of fresh water. 'The quantity of fresh water is quite limited in the country,' she added. According to her, climate change is the primary cause of the depletion of water resources. She said that the shortage of water triggered concerns about the future availability of water for the world’s exponentially rising population.\n\nSaiqa Imran said that in most cases, the water table was constantly going down as a result of the frequent pumping of water from the ground. 'With a growing world population, the more we pump water from the ground at a rapid rate, the harder it becomes to get the amount of water we need because we pump the groundwater faster than it can be replenished,' she added. She said that inefficient water distribution and mismanagement were the main causes of the water shortage. 'Pakistan has one of the largest contiguous irrigation systems in the world where more than 93% of water is used by the agriculture sector, 5% by the domestic sector and 2% by the industrial sector,' said the expert.\n\nShe said that domestic and industrial sectors would use 15% more water by 2025 than their current consumption. She said that the agriculture sector was the biggest user of water as modern irrigation techniques were not adopted in Pakistan but its contribution to the national economy was declining with the passage of time. Saiqa Imran said that the world’s average storage capacity reached 40% but Pakistan could conserve only up to 10% of its annual river water due to insufficient space. 'People have turned to use underground water as a result of the shortage of the most essential commodity. The indiscriminate over-pumping in the cities in the absence of regulatory bodies has also led to the depletion of groundwater,' she added.\n\nAccording to her, there is a dire need to devise a proper pricing mechanism for water usage in any sector. She said that incentives should also be in place to encourage people to use water efficiently. The expert said that the country could take a variety of technical and management measures to conserve water at all levels, reduce irrigation losses, encourage farmers to adopt more efficient irrigation methods by creating a regulatory framework, launch licensing water, and implement integrated water resource management. 'Under the principle of private sector participation and optimal water pricing, the policymakers should rethink water policy to encourage wastewater recycling,' Saiqa Imran told WealthPK.", "domain": "", "labels": {"narrative": ["Other"], "subnarrative": ["Other"]}}, {"article_id": "EN_CC_100021.txt", "content": "Collaborative plans, innovation keys to circular RMG industry: stakeholders \n\n Stakeholders at a programme on Sunday said that collaborative strategies and innovation were keys to unlocking Bangladesh’s circular apparel industry for availing a significant opportunity for the country to reduce its environmental impact, improve its economic performance and create social benefits.\n\nThe readymade garment sector in Bangladesh is under a transformative journey towards circularity, but embracing circularity also poses certain challenges that must be collectively considered and resolved, they said.\n\nA panel of industry leaders, policymakers and experts in circular economies made the comments at an event titled ‘Switch to Upstream Circularity Dialogue: Pre-consumer Textile Waste in Bangladesh’ at the Amari Hotel in Dhaka on Sunday.\n\nThe event was organised under the Switch to Circular Economy Value Chains project (SWITCH2CE), co-funded by the European Union and the government of Finland.\n\nParliamentary standing committee on the ministry of environment, forest and climate change chairman Saber Hossain Chowdhury was present in the opening session as chief guest.\n\nBangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association president Faruque Hassan spoke at the opening session as special guest.\n\nDeputy head of European Union to Bangladesh delegation mission Bernd Spanier, SWITCH2CE chief technical adviser Mark Draeck, among others, also contributed to the event’s opening session.\n\nHilde van Duijn, head of Global Value Chains, Circle Economy, also participated in the event and made circular game demonstration.\n\nFaruque Hassan said, ‘Living in a world in our time where climate is most threatened, business as usual is no more an option.

We’re all in this together, so let’s act now to deliver a healthier future for generations to come.\n\nJennifer Ho, La Crescenta\n\n..\n\nTo the editor: The California Restaurant Assn. is on the wrong side of history in its opposition to all-electric kitchens. Sadly, this is not the first time restaurant associations have opposed public health and safety measures. In fact, restaurant associations once fought smoke-free laws, with funding from Big Tobacco.\n\nTo protect public health and reduce climate emissions from gas stoves, our kitchens and homes will need to be upgraded from gas to electric. Thankfully, induction cooking is a superior cooking technology that keeps kitchens cooler and safer. For chefs cooking primarily with woks, there are electric woks.\n\nClimate change and the health dangers of gas are not going away. Instead of ignoring the problem or fighting health-protective solutions, our field must innovate to continue to prepare the dishes we love safely for our families and customers — and the planet.\n\nChristopher Galarza, Verona, Pa.\n\nThe writer is a chef and culinary sustainability consultant.", "domain": "", "labels": {"narrative": ["Other"], "subnarrative": ["Other"]}}, {"article_id": "EN_CC_100005.txt", "content": "Climate Crazies Fail in Attempt to Vandalize Another Classic Work of Art \n\n Another of the world’s most recognized and most valuable pieces of art was the target of climate-change activists. Climate crazies tried — and failed — to glue themselves to Edvard Munch’s 1893 painting 'The Scream' in Oslo on Friday.\n\nIt was yet another example of climate change activists using priceless works of art to protest the use of fossil fuels, which climate zealots believe is leading to global warming. In October, climate activists attacked 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' by Johannes Vermeer in The Hague. Climate hysterics were also responsible for an attack on Van Gogh’s 'Sunflowers' and John Constable’s 'The Hay Wain' in London over the summer.\n\nThe new climate-related vandalism fad seems to have begun with an attack on Da Vinci’s 'Mona Lisa' in which a climate fanatic feigned a disability in order to get close enough to smear a pastry on the painting.\n\nIn addition, 'Peach Trees in Blossom' by Van Gogh; 'My Heart’s in the Highlands' by Horatio McCulloch; 'Tomson’s Aeolian Harp' by J.M.W. Turner; 'The Last Supper' by Giampietrino; 'Sistine Madonna' by Raphael; and 'Haystacks' by Monet have been targeted by climate hysterics since May.\n\nAs of yet, none of the artwork has been damaged, due to being protected by glass.\n\nVideo of Friday’s attack shows two young climate vandals attempting to glue themselves to the artwork. Police apprehended the hooligans, and reported there was some glue residue on the glass that protects the paintings.\n\n'I scream for people dying,' one of the activists shouted.\n\n'I scream when lawmakers ignore science,' the other shouted.\n\nThe Norwegian climate activist group Stopp Oljeletinga, which translates to 'Stop Oil Exploration,' claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe group demands that the Norwegian government declare 'an immediate halt to all further exploration for oil on the Norwegian continental shelf,' and present 'a concrete plan for fair adjustment for today’s oil workers.'\n\nA spokesperson for the group claimed that the vandalism was an attempt to 'pressure lawmakers into stopping oil exploration.'\n\n'We are campaigning against ‘Scream’ because it is perhaps Norway’s most famous painting,' said Astrid Rem, a spokesperson for Stopp Oljeletinga. 'There have been lots of similar actions around Europe. They have managed something that no other action has managed: achieve an extremely large amount of coverage and press.'\n\nBut there’s good press and there’s bad press. These crazy antics are of the bad variety.\n\nNorway is one of the world’s top oil exporters and provides oil and natural gas to much of Europe, a continent in the midst of a serious energy crunch brought about partly by the war in Ukraine. Russia, the largest supplier of natural gas to Europe, has severely restricted supplies and has shut down the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which it claims was sabotaged.\n\nWithout much-needed Norwegian fossil fuels, Europe could be in for an extremely cold winter.\n\nThe art world has acknowledged their concern over the new phenomenon:\n\n'In recent weeks, there have been several attacks on works of art in international museum collections. The activists responsible for them severely underestimate the fragility of these irreplaceable objects, which must be preserved as part of our world cultural heritage,' read a statement signed by approximately one hundred gallery directors and museums.\n\nThese climate crazies are apparently willing to allow a continent to freeze this winter over their fears of an over-hyped 'problem' peddled by globalists who flew more than 400 carbon-spewing private jets to COP27 in Egypt last week.

We lived in a quiet town with a village green, a local dairy around the corner, and houses lining Main Street that were built in the mid-1700s.\n\nUnlike the deep snows that blanket Vermont in the winter, we lived farther south, in an area known for legendary ice storms. It’s like the weather can’t make up its mind whether to rain or snow, so it rains—then decides to freeze.\n\nWhen I was in high school, we had the mother of all ice storms. The frozen rain had left almost half an inch of ice on everything from roads and rooftops to the tiniest of twigs. The trees, unable to bear the weight of so much ice, lost branches or were ripped from the ground completely. The branches and felled trees blocked roads and pulled down power lines. We huddled in front of our fireplace, making meals on a camp stove for the better part of a week, without power or heat.\n\nThe ice clung stayed for several days. And then one evening, the mercury climbed from below-freezing to 50 degrees in a matter of hours. My dad and I went outdoors to watch the weather change, and because we lived on a hill, we could see what was happening across much of the Connecticut River Valley.\n\nAs the thermometer rapidly rose, the tons of ice began falling from the trees and rooftops with a deafening roar. The broken power lines thawed and then lit up the sky with dangerous blue explosions of electricity.\n\nDad and I watched in wonder as our frozen, ice-caked world thawed. He turned to me and said, 'You’ll never forget this night for as long as you live.'\n\nMy dad has been gone now for almost two decades, but that evening, his comment, is how I like to remember him. The awe of Mother Nature was unforgettable. But it was also that my dad, a slide-rule-carrying engineer would fearlessly turn to his then-snotty teen-aged daughter and express his amazement and wonder of the world. That’s what I remember most.*\n\nI choose to remember that evening, that moment in time when I think about my dad because it makes me smile. But it was also a profound moment because my father, who was a deeply religious man, was tacitly acknowledging that our connection with nature is also about our relationship with God or the universe or however you define the divine.\n\nThe point is that when you stop, observe, and admire the incredible operating system that is nature, how can you be anything but in awe? Nature has the ability to turn a tiny seed into a tree or an ear of corn, just by adding air, water, and sunlight. It keeps the oceans just the right amount of salinity to sustain the lives of fish and other aquatic animals. Our planet provides millions of species of plants, animals, and insects everything they need to survive.\n\nAnd yet, we get caught up in our lives and often lose touch with nature for long periods of time. Long enough for critical habitat to be turned into parking lots and for rainforests to be cut down. Long enough for our air to become toxic, and for the Colorado River to run empty before it reaches the ocean.\n\nI don’t pretend to have any answers, except for the baby step of reexamining your relationship with the natural world.

This speculation is nothing new, but what’s different this time around is that the attempted assassination of Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico will be on every voter’s mind, thus likely influencing the outcome.\n\nThe preceding hyperlinked analysis argued that fake news was responsible for radicalizing the pro-Ukrainian suspect into thinking that shooting his premier was a legitimate form of protest against what he’d been misled by the media into believing was his 'pro-Russian dictator with blood on his hands'. This black swan event might have served the short-term interests of that leader’s many enemies, but the blowback could be considerable if it leads to a conservative landslide during next month’s elections.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban predicted that the upcoming vote will influence the direction of war and peace in Europe, and while the European Parliament admittedly can’t do much in terms of shaping the NATO-Russian proxy war in Ukraine, it could still exert positive pressure if conservatives win. It’s with that in mind that Eurocrats like von der Leyen and Jourova are fearmongering about Russian meddling since they want to preemptively discredit this potential outcome.\n\nTo be sure, the first of those two had no idea that an assassination attempt would be made against Fico the day after she shared her earlier mentioned warning, but the second’s assessment about the upcoming elections being a test of the bloc’s disinformation resilience came some days later. Instead of speaking vaguely about alleged Russian meddling, the Eurocrats are now honing their information warfare narrative to muddle the conversation about Fico’s attempted assassination and its political aftermath.\n\nThe targeted audience is the unclear number of on-the-fence voters who might usually lean liberal but have recently begun to sympathize with some conservative positions on issues like Ukraine. Last week’s incident was driven by the liberal media’s fake news about the Slovak leader, which might influence some of these voters to give the more narratively responsible conservatives their support. In an attempt to desperately prevent this, the Eurocrats want them think that it would be doing Russia’s bidding.\n\nIf the European Parliamentary elections have absolutely no effect on anything, then they wouldn’t care who votes for whom, but the outcome will clearly at the very least have a major impact on popular perceptions and could lead to cascading consequences like more anti-war protests across the bloc. It’s for this reason that the Eurocrats and their media allies, including those being promoted by state-run Ukrainian outlets like this one here, are pushing the abovementioned information warfare narrative.\n\nThe growing gap between liberals and conservatives over Ukraine, which is foreign policy issue that Fico was most closely associated with, is naturally occurring as a result of their polar opposite worldviews and not due to Russian meddling. It’s so emotive and significant that some from both sides have become single-issue voters who’ll cast their ballots purely based on candidates’ positions towards this.

The first member of Belgium’s French-speaking Green party to be put in charge of an economic portfolio, she shows the scope for bottom-up EU policy changes.\n\nSetting an example\n\nTrachte helped put in place a Brussels law that, starting in 2024, has made regional subsidies for research organisations, companies, public administrations and civil society conditional on respect for social and environmental standards. She believes the EU should do the same for its €95.5 billion research programme known as Horizon Europe.\n\n‘Sometimes you need a revolution – or at least a mini revolution,’ Trachte told Horizon Magazine.\n\nShe said that Europe’s regions have a key role to play in advancing the continent’s transition to a net-zero economy.\n\nWith the EU seeking to become climate neutral by 2050 under the European Green Deal, Horizon Europe has placed increasing emphasis on projects to hasten the switch towards clean energy and away from fossil fuels and to ensure the process is socially fair.\n\nAlready the third-biggest part of the EU budget, Horizon Europe would have even greater impact on green and social matters across the continent by following the example set by the Brussels-Capital Region.\n\nIn a nutshell, €50 million of subsidies granted annually by the region for research and innovation require recipients to respect a do-no-harm principle and have a positive impact on the environment or social equality, according to Stephanie Lepczynski, who is Trachte’s policy adviser.\n\n‘We are showing the way and we hope that this can influence the European Commission by encouraging it to put environmental, social and governance criteria into the eligibility of Horizon projects,’ Lepczynski said at the European Research and Innovation Days event in Brussels on 20-21 March 2024.\n\nSecrets to success\n\nGender and transborder-cooperation requirements currently in place for EU funding help ensure greater diversity in research teams and produce scientific results that better reflect the make-up of society, according to Lepczynski.\n\nShe said that social and environmental conditionality in Horizon Europe would force researchers systematically to check that they’re acting for the common good and help ensure that funding advances EU green and social goals.\n\nTrachte said such conditions will also be merited in the successor programme of Horizon Europe, which runs for seven years through 2027.\n\n‘I wish for the next EU framework programme to decide the same – to have a greater impact and make a bigger contribution to the objectives of the European Green Deal,’ she said.\n\nFor Trachte, EU projects can have the most impact where academic, industry, government, civil society and the environment interact.\n\nThis is known as the 'quintuple helix' approach to innovation. It has led governments increasingly to prioritise public involvement in innovation processes.\n\n‘This ensures that research is rooted in society and geared towards finding solutions to today’s major societal challenges such as climate degradation, growing socio-economic inequalities or democracies,’ Trachte said.\n\nMission driven\n\nShe singled out as particularly important the five Horizon Europe 'Missions': adapting to climate change, fighting cancer, restoring oceans, cleaning up soil and establishing 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030.\n\n‘The five Missions are a very innovative tool to make the societal challenges stand out – in particular the triple crisis of climate, biodiversity and pollution and the health challenges related to it,’ Trachte said.\n\nIn Brussels, the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission was notably successful in bringing together regional and local administrations as well as other partners from the private sector.\n\n‘The enthusiasm created behind the Missions has mobilised many different actors,’ Trachte said.\n\nThe views of the interviewees don’t necessarily reflect those of the European Commission.\n\nThis article was originally published in Horizon the EU Research and Innovation Magazine.", "domain": "", "labels": {"narrative": ["Other"], "subnarrative": ["Other"]}}, {"article_id": "EN_CC_100150.txt", "content": "China shares inclusive development with the world: Former Director-General of UNESCO \n\n China shares inclusive development with the world: Former Director-General of UNESCO\n\nFormer Director-General of UNESCO, Irina Bokova, receives an exclusive interview with People's Daily Online in Beijing, Sep. 10, 2024. (People's Daily Online/Zhang Wenjie).\n\nChina's modernization and inclusive development have helped 1.4 billion Chinese people, set examples, and shared experiences with other countries, benefiting the world as a whole, said Irina Bokova, former Director-General of UNESCO.\n\nBokova, who is also the Honorary Dean of the School of International Organizations at Beijing Foreign Studies University, visited China several times and voiced her appreciation for China's rapid progress over the last several decades, stating that China's tremendous economic, social, and technological advancements have contributed significantly to the experience of the globe. She also noted that through cooperation mechanisms such as BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, China is fulfilling its obligation to share its inclusive growth with other countries.\n\n'UNESCO and China have together developed many joint activities, partnerships and initiatives, among my most memorable moments was President Xi Jinping's visit to UNESCO a decade ago,' Bokova told People's Daily Online during an exclusive interview.\n\nIn 2014, Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered a keynote speech at the headquarters of UNESCO in Paris, laying out his vision of civilization that features diversity, equality and inclusiveness.\n\n'We need to encourage different civilizations to respect each other and live together in harmony while promoting their exchanges and mutual learning as a bridge of friendship among peoples, a driving force behind human society, and a strong bond for world peace,' President Xi said.\n\n'President Xi's speech about diversity is very important, it shows that though we belong to different cultures, we are all members of one shared community,' said Bokova.\n\nAccording to Bokova, China is fulfilling its responsibility to share its success with the rest of the world by promoting collaboration and inclusive development. For example, China was the first developing country to realize one of the UN Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction, making a significant contribution to the global poverty alleviation cause.\n\n'China's commitment, inclusive development, and strong leadership demonstrate to the world that equality and inclusion in society are attainable. This benefits not only the Chinese people, but also other countries around the world,' added Bokova.\n\nBokova has also praised China's 'new quality productive forces'. With innovation playing the leading role, new quality productive forces are forces that feature advanced productivity and are free from traditional economic growth modes and productivity development paths. They are defined by high-tech, high efficiency and high quality, and are in line with the new development philosophy.\n\n'It is a very interesting and innovative concept China is taking. I think it is justified because the world and global economy are entering a new phase, and it is critical to use innovation and technology to encourage young people to use all of the potential of science to achieve equality and social inclusion, as well as to address challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss,' said Bokova, adding that 'new quality productive forces' have the potential to reconcile humans with nature while maintaining all of the benefits of technological progress.\n\nPhotos\n\nRelated Stories\n\n- Xi extends festive greetings to teachers\n\n- Xi: Build leading nation in education\n\n- Xi stresses building China into leading country in education\n\n- Beijing cements ties with Madrid, Oslo\n\n- Xi extends Teachers' Day greetings to teachers\n\n- Former Director General of UNESCO extends Teachers’ Day greetings to Chinese educators\n", "domain": "", "labels": {"narrative": ["Other"], "subnarrative": ["Other"]}}, {"article_id": "EN_UA_101067.txt", "content": "First war of TikTok era sees tragedy, humor and deceit \n\n eart-rending videos of artillery strikes are being served up alongside funny snippets such as bomb-shelter cooking tips and invasion misinformation as the war in Ukraine plays out on TikTok.\n\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine, millions of people have tuned into the hugely popular social networking service for news and views of what is happening on the battleground.\n\nThat was not lost on United States officials who hosted a video call to brief popular TikTok 'influencers' on details about the war, according to posts at the social network.\n\n'Lots of people have been turning to digital creators to learn about the invasion of Ukraine,' read a tweet Friday by Gen-Z for Change, a nonprofit focused on using social media to promote civil discourse.\n\n'Yesterday, we joined the @WhiteHouse and @WHNSC for a briefing on the United States' strategic goals in Ukraine so we're better able to debunk misinformation,' it added, referring to the White House National Security Council.\n\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine, music-themed video clips in Marta Vasyuta's account gave way to images of soldiers and the ravages of war.\n\nStuck in London, the 20-year-old Ukrainian exchange student uses TikTok to share glimpses of the tragedy inflicted on people still in her home country.\n\n'My mission is to spread information, to not stop talking about that, because it really matters,' said the economics student from Lviv, whose videos have logged millions of views.\n\nValeria Shashenok stayed in the city of Cherniguiv, northeast of Kyiv, and switched to English to broaden the reach of her sometimes surreal wartime TikTok posts.\n\nIn one, she shows how to cook borscht in a bomb shelter.

My life is ruined, and there is nothing left for me but irony.'\n\nHer TikTok clips include one of her in a basement in Odessa, quipping that Ukrainians' idea of going for a walk now is a jaunt to the nearest shelter.\n\nShe said the line between what was funny and what was hurtful was no longer clear, given the suffering and fear afflicting so many.\n\nBut the appetite for wartime content at TikTok appears strong, with Vasyuta and Shashenok seeing their accounts’ subscriber ranks multiply.\n\nYouthful sass\n\nWhile breaking news events such as armed conflicts have featured on social media for years, TikTok tends to feature spontaneity and a bit of sass that has proven particularly popular with younger audiences.\n\nIn the US where members of Gen Z, born in the late 1990s, shun traditional television, online platforms like TikTok are prime sources of news.\n\n'I hope that the kids who watch this war unfold on TikTok become opposed to war [and] realize the horrors and dangers of it,' said US high school history teacher Chris Dier, who is also a TikTok creator.\n\n'What I don't want is for it to desensitize them and normalize war.'\n\nYoung TikTok users were also being 'bombarded' with propaganda that they likely needed help navigating, said Dier.\n\nTikTok told AFP that it had ramped up resources to detect and counter 'emerging threats' and 'harmful disinformation' on the platform.\n\nOn March 6, the subsidiary of China-based ByteDance suspended the uploading of videos in Russia in reaction to a new law making it a crime to 'discredit' the Russian military.\n\nThe flow of pro-Russian messages has noticeably declined at TikTok, with the most popular account being state-backed news agency RIA Novosti, which is known for false or discredited claims, such as the alleged existence of secret bioweapons labs in Ukraine.\n\nShare your experiences, suggestions, and any issues you've encountered on The Jakarta Post.

'This will be not easy to do that ... nobody feels safety in our country right now in this very difficult situation. Everyone [is] ready to fight, ready to defend our city.'\n\n'I am not worried about kidnap,' he added. 'I am ready to fight, that's why I have weapons, that's why it's my hometown and I want to defend the interest of my citizens, the interest of my home, the interest of my family.'\n\nUkrainian officials announced the kidnapping of Dniprorudne Mayor Matveev Sergeevich on Sunday, while they said that Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov was captured two days earlier. Russia went on to appoint a Moscow-friendly mayor in Melitopol.\n\nWhile commenting on the kidnapping of Fedorov, which was partially captured on video, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asserted that 'the actions of Russian invaders will be equated with the actions of ISIS terrorists.'\n\nKlitschko suggested that the kidnappings were part of a pattern of 'un-human' Russian troops choosing to ignore the international rules of war, noting that mayors are civilian targets.\n\n'War also has rules,' said Klitschko. 'But Russians [don't] want the rules ... what they want is the symbol ... they can't break the mood of the people and that's why they kidnap the mayors.'\n\n'Its actually against all rules,' Klitschko continued. 'We see how unfriendly, how un-human activity make Russians in our land.'\n\nFollowing Russian bombing campaigns on Monday, the Kyiv mayor surveyed scenes of damage in the city alongside his brother Wladimir Klitschko, who is also a former world heavyweight boxing champion.\n\n'That's what Russia's war against the civilians looks like,' Wladimir Klitschko said while standing in the rubble in a video uploaded to Twitter. 'Destroyed buildings, destroyed infrastructure. [A] city bus just got hit by a rocket.

Boot’s argument is delusional, but then neocons thrive on lies and delusions.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nPropaganda, pure and simple. Boot is an accessory to mass murder, having advocated the invasion of Iraq, the slaughter of over a million Iraqis, and the engineered destruction of their country.\n\nThe hypocritical ICC didn’t bother to contrast and compare Putin’s supposed abduction of Ukrainian children to an organized mass kidnapping of Vietnamese children. It was dubbed 'Operation Babylift,' ordered by then President Ford, and was conducted at the end of the Vietnam War as the USG evacuated, having lost the war.\n\nThe Vietnamese children abducted without permission were described as 'orphans,' although many had parents and relatives that were left behind. 3,300 children, described as 'infants' (many were older children), were parceled out to families in America, Australia, West Germany, and France.\n\nThe 'rescue' of these children was an organized act of kidnapping pure and simple, yet in the Land of Amnesia, millions of Americans know nothing about it (or, for that matter, the Vietnam War itself and the brutal destruction of Southeast Asia).\n\nIn 1975, a class action suit was filed in San Francisco on behalf of the kidnapped children.\n\n'The suit seeks to enjoin adoption proceedings until it has been ascertained either that the parents or appropriate relatives in Vietnam have consented to their adoption or that these parents or relatives cannot be found,' The Adoption History Project notes. 'The Complaint alleged that several of the Vietnamese orphans brought to the United States under Operation Babylift stated they are not orphans and that they wish to return to Vietnam.'\n\nA statement issued on April 4, 1975, by 'professors of ethics and religion,' pointed out that many 'of the children are not orphans; their parents or relatives may still be alive, although displaced, in Vietnam… The Vietnamese children should be allowed to stay in Vietnam where they belong.'\n\nThe operation was celebrated by the corporate media and 'Hollywood’s celebrity elite… [and, as a propaganda event] generated a spectacle of celebration and emphasized that the babies were more than just average orphans,' writes US History Scene.\n\nUncritical acceptance of the Vietnam war orphans did not last long. A variety of American voices that ranged from child psychologists to news reporters to the casual observer soon began asking whether the evacuation served the best interests of the children. This concern followed closely on the heels of criticism over U.S. motivation for the evacuation. Much of this controversy began when the unclear orphan status of some of the children came to light. The government of South Vietnam reluctantly allowed so many children to leave the country only under the condition that those who left would already be in the adoption process. Volunteers processing the children found that not all of them fit into this category of orphan. In the processing centers, some of the children told the volunteers that they were not orphans and had families living back in Vietnam.\n\nNaturally, Operation Babylift is all but forgotten today. It would be counterproductive to the onslaught of USG and ICC propaganda, not directed at the welfare of children, but rather as a crude 'informational' device to further turn opinion against Russia’s SMO to denazify and disarm Ukraine and, in addition, prevent NATO from undermining Russian national security.\n\nRead More @ kurtnimmo.substack.com", "domain": "URW", "labels": {"narrative": ["Discrediting the West, Diplomacy", "Distrust towards Media", "Blaming the war on others rather than the invader", "Discrediting the West, Diplomacy", "Discrediting Ukraine"], "subnarrative": ["The West is overreacting", "Western media is an instrument of propaganda", "The West are the aggressors", "Other", "Ukraine is associated with nazism"]}}, {"article_id": "EN_UA_024847.txt", "content": "Polish Foreign Minister Reveals Biden Knew About Nord Stream Explosion in Advance \n\n The United States knew in advance about the attacks on the Nord Stream pipeline, the largest act of industrial terrorism in history, but did not step in to prevent them, according to an interview with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski published today.\n\nIn September 2022, Sikorski, then a member of the European Parliament (MEP), insinuated that Washington was complicit in the attack on the Nord Stream gas pipeline.\n\nSikorski tweeted a photo from the scene of the crime and signed it 'Thank you, USA.'

The company is among the top European suppliers of 155mm artillery shells, tanks, armored vehicles, and other crucial military equipment to Kiev.\n\nThe Kremlin is calling it fantasy and pointing to zero evidence being presented alongside the major accusation. Here's how the bombshell CNN report published late this past week began: 'US intelligence discovered earlier this year that the Russian government planned to assassinate the chief executive of a powerful German arms manufacturer that has been producing artillery shells and military vehicles for Ukraine, according to five US and western officials familiar with the episode.'\n\nThere have been widespread allegations for several months in Western media pointing to an irregular and covert Russian warfare campaign to conduct sabotage missions against European defense and manufacturing companies supplying Ukraine.\n\nThe CNN report alluded to these prior stories: 'The plot was one of a series of Russian plans to assassinate defense industry executives across Europe who were supporting Ukraine’s war effort, these sources said.' It detailed further that 'The plan to kill Armin Papperger, a white-haired goliath who has led the German manufacturing charge in support of Kyiv, was the most mature.'\n\nIn recent months, there have been several instances of fires engulfing weapons and ammo manufacturing sites in the UK and on the European continent, some of which we detailed previously. Simultaneously, Russia has been subject of similarly mysterious blazes at defense contractor buildings and companies.\n\nAs for the alleged plot to take out the CEO of Rheinmetal, the CNN story is sourced entirely to anonymous intelligence officials, making it impossible to verify at this point, other than taking the word of US, German, and NATO officials.\n\nAccording to more from the original CNN report, 'When the Americans learned of the effort, they informed Germany, whose security services were then able to protect Papperger and foil the plot.

In the past, I’ve taken my gasoline cars in for regular service, and they were rotating my tires as needed during this service. Not taking my EV in for service, I never got the rotation done. That not only meant the drive tires of my car wore out faster, it also meant I could not make a warranty claim on them. Lesson learned.'\n\nElectric vehicles do incur charges for what is classified as a repair rather than maintenance. Many Tesla 12v batteries have been reported to fail, albeit most are still under warranty. If you chip a windshield, bang a mirror, or get a car burglary, parts for premium cars are always pricey. He admits that neglecting to rotate the tires properly may have been his fault, but he contends that the added weight of his electric car, along with the necessity for high-efficiency, low-noise tires, meant an expensive purchase was always on the horizon. Apart from that, he characterizes the advantages of owning an electric vehicle as a world of guilt-free driving.\n\nLike Pete Buttigieg, who urged average Americans to buy electric cars to avoid high gas costs while ignoring the $56,000 price tag, which has already proven to be a money trap.\n\nNonetheless, in light of this revelation, it appears that the tradeoff of electric vehicles – fewer environmental impacts for a higher price – is having the opposite effect.\n\nRegular tread replacement will have an impact on the environment, both because of the fossil fuels required to manufacture them and because wear and tear contribute more harmful microplastics to the environment.\n\nGiven that modern tires contain petroleum-based plastics, a car tire requires between 7 and 22 gallons of oil to manufacture, according to a National Geographic article.\n\nSomehow, one of these is frowned upon (tar sands), but the other three- cobalt, nickel and lithium mines (necessary for EV batteries) are 'green'? 🤔 pic.twitter.com/iahDDqZRls\n\n— Patrick De Haan ⛽️📊 (@GasBuddyGuy) November 11, 2021\n\nMicroplastics become embedded in shrimp gills and guts, according to a study conducted by John Weinstein, a professor of physiology at The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\n'Somehow, one of these is frowned upon (tar sands), but the other three- cobalt, nickel, and lithium mines (necessary for EV batteries) are 'green?'

The good news: most Americans still oppose ditching fossil fuels and gas cars altogether.\n\nPew Research Center published the results of its new survey on June 28. While climate alarmists’ predictions have been consistently and wildly wrong for 50 years now, with one unscientific claim after another proven false, the media, government, and institutions continue pounding in the narrative — and with some apparently considerable effects:\n\n- 74% of Americans say they support the country’s participation in international efforts to reduce the effects of climate change.\n\n- 67% of U.S. adults prioritize the development of alternative energy sources such as wind, solar and hydrogen power over increasing the production of fossil fuel energy sources.\n\nI have previously explained in more detail how 'green' energy is actually toxic for the environment, besides being inefficient and unprofitable. In other words, 'green' energy is a lose-lose option. Solar panels and wind turbines have killed billions of birds, for instance, and offshore wind turbines can be deadly for whales (not to mention, wind turbines and solar panels generate plenty of toxic waste). And those 'green' electric vehicles (EV)? EV batteries, which have to be replaced every few years, are very toxic to manufacture and dispose of.\n\nPerhaps Americans are starting to realize that:\n\n[Pew:] Less than half of the public (40%) favors phasing out the production of gas-powered cars and trucks. Support for this policy is 7 percentage points lower than it was two years ago. And underscoring the strong feelings big changes to American life can engender, 45% say they would feel upset if gas-powered cars were phased out; fewer than half as many (21%) would feel excited.\n\nYou mean Americans don’t want to switch to unreliable electric cars that have to depend upon an already strained grid? No way!\n\nIf Pew is to be believed, however, Americans are a little too credulous of the narrative that carbon is about to make this planet into a ball of fire. (Spoiler: it isn’t):\n\n- 76% favor providing a tax credit to businesses that develop carbon capture technologies and 70% support taxing corporations based on their carbon emissions.\n\n- 61% favor requiring power plants to eliminate all carbon emissions by the year 2040\n\nOne very simple truth that the climate alarmists don’t want you to know is that carbon is absolutely essential for life on Earth. Indeed, increased carbon actually helps plants — including food crops — thrive. Human, plant, or animal, we need carbon. So drastically reducing carbon could hurt humans and devastate crops and plants.\n\nIreland to require farmers to reduce cattle herds by one-third by 2030 to save planet.\n\nFarmers to reduce carbon footprint through bankruptcy.https://t.co/YyZGxlPLNm\n\n— Steve Milloy (@JunkScience) February 7, 2023\n\nBy the way, a recent study found that CO2 emissions from fossil fuels are too low to cause global warming. That seems like important information, but don’t expect to see it in the mainstream media.\n\nRelated: WATCH: Cricketer Carries Climate Protester Off the Field\n\nIt is disappointing that so many Americans believe to some degree in the climate hoax after all these years.

ACCESS IT HERE!\n\nAmerican Interventionism Is Dangerous,\n\nBut Is It Worse than the Alternative?\n\nI’ve been here before, only I didn’t know it. When I born in the summer of 1984, the world had already escaped nuclear holocaust on a number of occasions, but the biggest close calls happened in the early 1980s, with one of them so close to a Soviet-American thermonuclear war that the Soviet officer who de-escalated the event is dubbed 'the man that saved the world' – Stanislav Petrov.\n\nLike all incredible lucky stories, Stanislav was called to duty at the last second, because the officer originally assigned to the shift was sick.\n\nSuddenly, his screen was filled with notices of nuclear warheads headed to the Soviet Union from the United States, and he had to decide whether or not to call Moscow ASAP and alert them that in five minutes, the entire country would be obliterated!\n\nBut something stopped him… he began reasoning that had the United States started on the path of nuclear war, they’d launch hundreds of missiles, not just a few, and decided to hold off and learn that no other station was reporting anything.\n\nSubsequently, he learned that this was a new satellite detection system that was totally useless, and that even flares from the clouds and sun could make it beep.\n\nBasically, he found out that the latest Soviet air defenses were garbage and was actually fired, instead of hailed for his deep thinking.\n\nI was born the year after Stanislav Petrov saved the world, including my own parents.\n\nNow, the Russians and NATO members are fighting a proxy war in Ukraine. France is ready to send troops to Ukraine already and, instead of having the country join NATO, it will essentially turn Ukraine into a buffer zone between Russia and the rest of Europe, but president Biden, of all people, is the one blocking it.\n\nNo wonder precious metals are soaring, but do I agree with hedge fund managers that it is overvalued?\n\nCourtesy: Zerohedge.com\n\nIn my opinion, gold is not overvalued, and its fair price is in the neighborhood of $2,582, whereas silver’s is around $37.\n\nIn the next few weeks, Biden will realize that France entering Ukraine, while showing that Washington is playing second fiddle to an emerging superpower in Europe. Washington stands to gain much from this, as it will drastically shift from policing the world to coalizing with other nations and keeping its influence, while isolating more and more, which is a very bi-partisan strategy.\n\nIf this happens, a head-on confrontation between France and Russia will send the human race back to the WW2 era, and I submit to you that French troops will then be reinforced by German, Polish and Italian ones.\n\nUkraine, in effect, will be like the Berlin Wall, separating Russia from Europe proper.\n\nIf you’re shaking your head in disbelief, just know that during Carter’s term in office, a 40c-worth chip malfunctioned once, prompting the screens to show that 2,000 Soviet warheads were en route to major American cities.

His report there turns upside-down and inside-out the Ukrainian Government’s ‘explanation’ that the dam had been bombed not by a missile, but by an explosive device which had been placed there by saboteurs whom Ukraine’s Government assumes were from Russia.

And whereas Russia doesn’t have any Storm Shadows, Ukraine definitely does — ever since May 12th.\n\nThe present news-report about U.S.-and-allied lies is being simultaneously submitted for publication by all of the standard U.S.-Government mouthpiece propaganda-media, just in case any of them might finally want to go beyond their standard U.S.-Government-approved sources.\n\nEver since at least late 2022, Russia has been warning that Ukraine’s government wants to blow up that dam. For example, on 1 November 2022, Reuters headlined 'Russia announces wider evacuation of occupied southern Ukraine', and reported that,\n\n'Due to the possibility of the use of prohibited methods of war by the Ukrainian regime, as well as information that Kyiv is preparing a massive missile strike on the Kakhovka hydroelectric station, there is an immediate danger of the Kherson region being flooded,' Vladimir Saldo, Russian-installed head of occupied Kherson province, said in a video message.\n\n'Given the situation, I have decided to expand the evacuation zone by 15 km from the Dnipro,' he said. 'The decision will make it possible to create a layered defence in order to repel Ukrainian attacks and protect civilians.'\n\nMoscow has accused Kyiv of planning to use a so-called 'dirty bomb' to spread radiation, or to blow up a dam to flood towns and villages in Kherson province. Kyiv says accusations it would use such tactics on its own territory are absurd, but that Russia might be planning such actions itself to blame Ukraine. …\n\nSaldo, the Russian-imposed occupation leader for the province, identified seven towns on the east bank that would now be evacuated, comprising the main populated settlements along that stretch of the river.\n\nEven U.S.-and-allied ‘news’-media occasionally report relevant facts when they find them useful to mention in a ‘news’-report that has an anti-Russian 'spin.'\n\nSo: we know that Russia’s Government was trying to protect the residents in that region against this attack, but U.S.-and-allied ‘news’-media have unquestioningly accepted the Ukrainian government’s accusation that Russia’s Government did it.

There is an 'incremental kind of back and forth between Ukraine and Russia', with 'incremental gains on both sides', Brown said.\n\nBut he noted that 'even as the Russians have gained territory, they do it at a pretty big cost in number of casualties, like in personnel, but also in number of pieces of equipment that are being taken out.'\n\nAustin said in his remarks Tuesday that 'Russia has paid a staggering cost for (President Vladimir) Putin’s imperial dreams', using 'up to $211 billion to equip, deploy, maintain, and sustain its imperial aggression against Ukraine.'\n\n'At least 315,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded' since Russia launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Austin said, adding that Ukraine has also 'sunk, destroyed, or damaged some 20 medium-to-large Russian navy vessels.'\n\nThe sinkings have been an embarrassment for Moscow and Russian state media confirmed Tuesday that the country had replaced the head of its navy. Austin and other US officials have spearheaded the push for international support for Ukraine, quickly forging a coalition to back Kyiv after Russia invaded and coordinating aid from dozens of countries.\n\nSpeaking at the Ramstein US base, German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said Berlin has offered another half a million euros worth of military aid to Ukraine. 'That includes 10,000 rounds of ammunition from the stock of our armed forces,' he told journalists.

These ideas include 'novel cell culture methods suitable for the production of cultivated meat or protein' – essentially a euphemism for lab-grown fake meat.\n\nLab-grown meat is a new technology where animal muscle and fat tissues are grown from modified animal cells in special equipment. This process uses a mix of chemicals, pressure and temperature to create meat that resembles beef, chicken and pork. Though still in the experimental stage, lab-grown meat has sparked a debate about its efficiency and ethics of producing meat without killing animals.

It zoomed in on the use of highly refined or purified growth media, which is used to help animal cells multiply. They wrote that lab-grown meat using purified media in its production has a global warming potential four to 25 times greater than the average compared to the real thing.\n\nHuman knowledge is under attack!

Although the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved two California companies to sell cultured chicken to restaurants in 2023, some believe taxpayer money shouldn’t fund the lab-grown meat industry.\n\nJack Hubbard, executive director for the Center for the Environment and Welfare (CEW), was among the vocal critics of the plan.

The opening stages of this war are already underway.'\n\nIsrael’s genocide in Gaza against Palestinians and its US-backed attacks against Iran are just one front in a rapidly emerging world war involving nuclear armed powers. US imperialism and its allies are already engaged in a war against Russia in Ukraine and are making advanced preparations for a catastrophic conflict with China.\n\nThe imperialist leaders as well as various media pundits now casually refer to a nuclear war as an acceptable strategic option, despite the grave threat it poses to the existence of humanity.\n\nThe Biden administration, along with other NATO powers, have repeatedly crossed the 'red lines' in Ukraine which they previously accepted as necessary to prevent nuclear war.\n\nOne might consider that the imperialist leaders—Biden, Sunak, Macron and Scholz—are criminally insane as they drag the planet towards nuclear conflagration. However, their policies are not simply the product of deranged individuals but of the profound crisis of world capitalism for which they have no rational, progressive solution and see a global war for domination as the only way out.\n\nWar is being accompanied by savage repression against any opposition as the terrible, continued persecution of Julian Assange for exposing the crimes of US imperialism graphically demonstrates.\n\nOur comrade Bogdan Syrotiuk of the Young Guard of Bolshevik Leninists has been detained by the fascistic Zelensky government in Ukraine earlier this month on false accusations of being a Russian agent. Bogdan has courageously opposed the war in Ukraine, along with his comrades in Russia, denounced both the Ukrainian and Russian regimes and fought for the unity of the Ukrainian and Russian working class.\n\nIn the US and other imperialist countries, brutal police crackdowns are taking place against protesters opposing the Gaza genocide with thousands of arrests including of students.\n\nThe ongoing anti-war protests in universities and cities are significant, but on their own are incapable of halting the bloodbath. For seven months, the Zionist regime and its imperialist backers have not only ignored protests by millions around the world, but they are also turning to police repression.\n\nThe only social force capable of halting the drive to world war is the international working class which is coming into struggle in Sri Lanka and around the world in opposition to the austerity program of the ruling classes. As governments engage in, support and prepare for war, it is workers who are forced to bear the burden.\n\nA struggle against war requires the building of a unified anti-war movement of the working class based on a socialist program, exposing the futility of protest politics and all the apologists for imperialism.

The administration, for example, wants half of all new cars and trucks sold in 2030 to be zero-emission, despite sputtering EV sales.\n\nAll 8 of the states and D.C. have adopted the Advanced Clean Cars II rule, and will have an outright ban on the sale of new gas-powered vehicles after 2035.\n\nCalifornia was the first to adopt the rule, aiming to have 35% of new vehicle sales emit zero emissions by 2026, and boosting that goal to 68% by 2030.\n\nAccording to the California Air Resources Board, the regulation overhauls the state’s 'growing zero-emission vehicle market and robust motor vehicle emission control rules and augments them to meet more aggressive tailpipe emissions standards and ramp up to 100% zero-emission vehicles.'\n\nAs noted by Money, the states’ plans to ban gas-powered vehicles have generally not required votes from lawmakers, but have been advanced with support from governors and environmental regulators.\n\nThe EV market has struggled in recent months, as highlighted by The Daily Wire. Ford, for example, had to cut 1,400 employees from its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center, rolled back the planned production number of the electric F-150 Lightnings in half, and slashed $12 billion in EV investments.\n\nPresident Biden, however, is not slowing down when it comes to targeting the gas-powered vehicle industry. Earlier this month, Biden’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set new eye-popping regulations in an effort to increase the number of electric vehicles on the road.\n\n\nThe new EPA rules set emission standards for vehicles made between 2027 and 2032 and would eliminate more than 7 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions, setting off concerns across the nation.\n\nFor example, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) railed against the EPA’s move, calling it both 'reckless' and 'ill-informed.'\n\n'The federal government has no authority and no right to mandate what type of car or truck Americans can purchase for their everyday lives,' the senator said.

However, he is not the only one who was humiliated and stunned by the success of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Russian territory. Ukraine's partners, among those who provide weapons but restrict their use, are in the same position.\n\nThis is the opinion of Colonel Richard Justin Kemp, a retired British Army officer and knight, who was awarded the highest honor in the UK. In his opinion, the Ukrainian offensive 'showed the cowardice of the allies,' especially US President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\n\nSir Richard Kemp recalls how President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had previously asked Western partners to allow the use of long-range weapons to protect both Ukrainian soldiers and Ukraine in general.\n\n'The British Storm Shadow missiles could make a difference in this battle, but the British government is unwilling to allow them to be used to their full potential. What, in Sir Keir Starmer's opinion, is the point of a strike on Russian territory, apart from protecting Ukraine? And how would the Second World War have ended if the Prime Minister had not allowed British and American bombs to fall on German soil?' asks the colonel.\n\nAccording to Sir Richard Kemp, throughout the entire period of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, 'the most pathetic were the Western allies' who pursued a policy not based on Ukraine's defense needs, 'but on the groundless fear of Russian retaliation.' And although all of Putin's so-called red lines turned out to be nothing more than baseless intimidation, each subsequent Western decision to provide Ukraine with long-range missiles, tanks, or combat aircraft 'was reluctant, half-hearted, inadequate, and gripped by fear.'\n\nIncidentally, it was these fears and the 'miserable policy' of the partners that ensured the success of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region, the Briton believes.\n\n'Ukraine was able to launch an unexpected attack on Russian territory because most of the border with the enemy was left almost unguarded. The fact is that Putin knew that his territory remained virtually invulnerable to attack because of Western restrictions on the use of weapons. This also applies to airfields, supply routes, and logistics bases. Significant forces needed to protect them have been thrown into the war in Ukraine,' the colonel said.\n\n'What Western leaders don't realize is that when you're facing a tyrant like Putin, escalation is the only language he fears and understands. We see the same thing in the Middle East, where Biden is pleading with Israel to de-escalate. But his unconvincing 'no' will not stop Ayatollah Khamenei from pushing the button and launching Iran's expected missile attack, just as it did not stop Putin from attacking Ukraine,' Sir Richard Kemp said.\n\nUkraine's offensive near Kursk has taught the West a 'salutary lesson,' the military said.\n\n'Despite the capture of thousands of square kilometers of Russia's holy shrines, no nuclear missiles were raining down on Kyiv. The truth is that if Ukraine had been allowed to escalate from the very beginning, it could have brought this war to an end on favorable terms for Kyiv,' the British colonel believes.\n\nOnly verified information is available on the OBOZ.UA Telegram channel and Viber.

The site was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List on Sunday during the extended 45th session of the World Heritage Committee ongoing in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nWith the addition of this new listing, China's number of UNESCO World Heritage sites has risen to 57. The Cultural Landscape of Old Tea Forests of the Jingmai Mountain in Pu'er is the very first tea-themed world cultural heritage site globally.\n\nOn what makes this site stand out and on what sort of cultural insights it offers, Li said the cultural landscape comprises five ancient tea forests, nine traditional villages and three protective forests, which maintain their vitality to this day.\n\n'According to archaeological findings, the cultivation of tea trees in ancient China can be traced back over 6,000 years,' Li said. 'Subsequently, tea culture and the practice of growing and consuming tea spread from China to neighboring countries and beyond.'\n\nThe cultural landscape has resulted in a unique protection system combining government management with grassroots governance, which ensures the protection of cultural and biological diversity and the sustainable use of natural resources, Li said.\n\nThis heritage, he said, also demonstrates the unique tradition of the complementary use of natural resources in mountainous environments by many of China's ethnic groups.\n\nIts success in achieving World Heritage Site status is 'a significant achievement in presenting an authentic picture of ancient and modern China to the world,' the official said.\n\nChina plans to implement preservation and management initiatives in five key areas, Li said.\n\nEmphasizing the importance of prioritizing protection and planning ahead, Li highlighted the need for the coordinated planning of protection and management measures for ancient tea forests, villages and traditional residential architecture. Such an approach aims to strike a balance between heritage preservation and development.\n\nFurthermore, China intends to invest in research on core technologies to enhance its monitoring capabilities for ancient tea forests as well as rare flora and rare fauna, and its capabilities for climate change responses.\n\nTo promote the sustainable development of its heritage sites, China aims to improve the participation mechanism for locals and other stakeholders. The involvement of local communities, particularly people from younger generations, will be encouraged and guided to contribute to the dissemination of tea culture and the growth of the tea industry.\n\nChina will continue to delve into the history of the tea industry, explore the philosophical depth of tea culture, and elucidate the global influence of Chinese tea culture. The country seeks to tap into the value of this heritage and promote its traditional culture further.\n\nThe official said that efforts are underway to promote the effective utilization and regulated development of cultural World Heritage Sites, aiming to breathe new life into these invaluable treasures. ■", "domain": "", "labels": {"narrative": ["Other"], "subnarrative": ["Other"]}}, {"article_id": "EN_UA_104876.txt", "content": "Putin honours army unit blamed for Bucha massacre with award for ‘heroism and bravery’ \n\n VLADIMIR Putin has honoured an army unit accused of war crimes and genocide in the Russian town of Bucha, reports suggest.\n\nA decree signed by the Russian tyrant gave the 64th Motor Rifle Brigade the title of guards – scandalously praising them for 'mass heroism and valour, tenacity and courage.'\n\nEarlier this month, the Ukrainian ministry identified the unit as those responsible for the alleged rape and murder of innocent Ukrainians.\n\nThe barbarous pack, headed by Lieutenant Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov -

According to him, the $6 million bribe that was paid in cash to shut down the investigation into the First Son’s scandal eventually found its way to the Ukrainian Armed Forces and its military-intelligence agency.\n\nDerkach claimed to have proof of the secret court order that divided these funds between those two, with the first investing its portion into building up their country’s drone army while the second financed terrorist attacks like the assassination of Darya Dugina, which he specifically mentioned in the interview. These allegations expand upon the ones that he shared earlier this year regarding the real-world impact of Hunter’s corruption scandal, which were analyzed here at the time.\n\nOn the subject of Ukrainian assassinations and terrorism, Derkach said that the CIA and FBI actually condone these actions despite their public claims to the contrary, but he warned that this immoral policy will inevitably ricochet into the US itself. In particular, he cited FBI chief Christopher Wray’s testimony to Congress last April where he said that law enforcement officials fear that Crocus-like attacks are presently being plotted against their country.\n\nAbout that, it shouldn’t be forgotten that Ukraine’s military-intelligence service GUR is the chief suspect of Russia’s investigation into what became one of the worst terrorist attacks in its history, thus meaning that the portion of Burisma’s $6 million bribe that made its way into their hands likely financed part of it. In other words, the third-order effect of Hunter’s corruption scandal is that it was partially responsible for the brutal murder of innocent civilians halfway across the world some years later.\n\nThat’s already scandalous enough, but Derkach shared even more details about the other indirect consequences of this cover-up into the First Son’s illicit activities, adding that some GUR-linked figures have been connected to the Western narrative about September 2022’s Nord Stream terrorist attack. He regards that story as a distraction from the US’ complicity, the view of which was elaborated upon here at the time that it entered the discourse, but lauded the CIA for the lengths it went to cover up its role.\n\nIn his view, the CIA might very well have sent a highly trained Ukrainian diving team to the Baltic Sea exactly as the Western media reported, though only to plant fake bombs. In his words, 'when a cover story is made, it is done quite well. We shouldn’t belittle the experience of the CIA or the experience of MI6 in preparing cover operations. They have quite a lot of experience in using proxies, in using cover stories to form a certain position in order to dodge responsibility. This is actually what happened.'\n\nLooking forward, Derkach expects Ukraine to attempt more terrorist attacks against Russia, which the US public is being preconditioned to accept via the CIA’s various leaks to the media. While many might lay the blame for all this on Zelensky’s lap, Derkach believes that it’s actually his Chief of Staff Andrey Yermak who’s running the show, albeit as a Western puppet. Nevertheless, he’s also convinced that the West is indeed preparing to formally replace Zelensky, but doesn’t yet know when or with whom.\n\nAltogether, the importance of Derkach’s interview is that he’s a former veteran Ukrainian politician who still retains a lot of sources inside the regime, having served in the Rada for a whopping 22 years from 1998-2020. While his homeland charged him with treason after he fled to Russia in early 2022, which followed the US charging him with election meddling on behalf of that country in September 2020, the argument can be made that these are politically driven attempts to intimidate a top whistleblower.\n\nThe dirt that Derkach shared about Hunter’s Burisma corruption scandal, not to mention its newly revealed third-order effects that led to the brutal killing of civilians halfway across the world after part of his company’s bribe made its way into GUR’s hands, made him an enemy of the US Government.

Several countries, including Russia, Australia and Israel are opposing efforts by other nations to pass a binding resolution at the United Nations calling for a ban on AI killer drones.\n\nThe issue surrounding the deployment of AI weapons has sparked intense debate, with key questions revolving around the role of human agency in the use of force. Austria’s chief negotiator on the matter, Alexander Kmentt, emphasised that this issue is not just a security and legal concern but also an ethical one.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pentagon has revealed plans to deploy swarms of AI-enabled drones as part of their AI weapons programme. These drones, equipped with advanced AI capabilities, are intended to provide the United States with a tactical advantage, countering the numerical superiority of China’s Liberation Army.\n\nUS Deputy Secretary of Defence Kathleen Hicks further highlighted the role of AI-controlled drone swarms in reshaping battlefield dynamics, making them harder to plan against, hit and defeat. However, concerns arise regarding human supervision and decision-making capabilities, as some argue that limitations on AI’s autonomy could hinder strategic advantages.\n\nCritics also point to recent incidents where AI drones have been utilised in conflict zones, such as Ukraine’s use of AI-controlled drones during its conflict with Russia. The extent of human casualties caused by these AI drones remains uncertain, raising additional concerns.\n\nAdvocacy groups like the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots warn that AI technology’s dehumanisation poses significant risks. This dehumanisation could not only impact the use of force but also permeate other aspects of our lives, extending to automation in law enforcement, smart homes, and beyond.

The details remain unclear, but it’s widely thought that he was killed by a precision drone strike at his residence. The world is watching to see whether Iran and/or its Resistance Axis allies will respond, what form it could take if so, and whether that would escalate tensions to a wider war.\n\nHere are five takeaways thus far:\n\n1. Israel’s Intelligence & Tactics Are Top-Notch\n\nIsrael somehow or another obtained accurate intelligence about Haniyeh’s location despite it being top-secret and was then able to successfully assassinate him. Whatever air defenses (including electronic warfare ones) that Iran had deployed in its capital as part of the security measures to protect its high-profile guests failed to thwart this attack. This is a major embarrassment for the Islamic Republic and prompts speculation about whether it was due to utter incompetence or was partially an inside job.\n\n2. Iran Is Caught In A Dilemma Over How To Respond\n\nIt’s unimaginable that Iran won’t respond to its Israeli enemy assassinating a high-profile allied guest in Tehran during the new president’s inauguration, but the dilemma is over the form that this response will take. Launching another drone and missile salvo against Israel like it did in the spring after the bombing of its consulate in Damascus is possible, though Israel could spin that as a failure if many of them are shot down like last time, the on-the-ground damage is minimal, and no high-profile targets are killed.\n\n3. Mutually Assured Destruction Hangs Heavy Over Everyone’s Head\n\nThe response that Iran resorts to will be determined by its leadership’s understanding of how far they can go without triggering the 'mutually assured destruction' (MAD) scenario, which both Israel and the Resistance Axis fear and is why they’ve thus far restrained themselves from waging all-out war. A repeat of spring’s salvo could remain below that threshold, but Iran might also respond in a different way that’s interpreted by Israel as an escalation, thus prompting its own escalation that could then lead to MAD.\n\n4. A Choreographed Response Might Therefore Be The Most 'Rational'…\n\nDuma member Dmitry Belik, whose claim to fame was helping Sevastopol reunify with Russia when he briefly served as the region’s acting head in spring 2014, described spring’s salvo as a 'beautiful theatrical production'. If there’s any truth to his innuendo that Iran choreographed its response with the US and/or Israel to Israel’s bombing of its consulate in Syria, then it might also do the same after Haniyeh’s assassination, which could help Iran 'save face' while averting an escalation towards MAD.\n\n5. …But There’s No Guarantee That Iran’s Allies Will 'Stand Down'\n\nHamas and Hezbollah are Iran’s allies but operate independently of it despite their close ties.

Putin certainly has the hardware for every scenario.\n\nAt his disposal are an estimated 5,977 warheads, of which 1,600 are ready to be deployed. This terrifying arsenal can be launched from land, submarines and planes.\n\nThey include non-strategic 'battlefield' nukes which have a smaller destructive power — and radioactive fallout — and are intended to destroy military capabilities rather than civilian populations. They can be anything from land mines to torpedos.\n\nThey have never been used in combat — so far.\n\nMost read in The Sun\n\nRussia also has the more feared strategic nuclear weapons, which can be launched as warheads on powerful long-range missiles.\n\nThey include intercontinental ballistic missiles which would take just 20 minutes to get to Britain — and 30 to the US. These strategic weapons, with deliberately terrifying names such as Satan, are designed to wipe out entire cities.\n\nUnleashing such weapons would come with a huge amount of risk for Putin. He knows Nato forces have an equally deadly stockpile, with the US retaining 5,428 warheads alongside the UK’s 225 and France’s 290.\n\nBut he may not care about retaliation.\n\nThe Russian leader suggested in 2018 he would be willing to see his homeland destroyed in a nuclear conflict.\n\nHe said: 'If someone decides to annihilate Russia, we have the legal right to respond. Yes, it will be a catastrophe for humanity and for the world. But I’m a citizen of Russia and its head of state.\n\n'Why do we need a world without Russia in it?'\n\nThis, though, was clearly a threat to respond in kind if Russia is ever attacked first.\n\nSam Ashworth-Hayes, of the Henry Jackson Society, told The Sun previously: 'I think there is only a risk of escalation if Nato forces did directly become involved in the war in Ukraine.\n\n'The message from Vladimir Putin to the West is to stay out of our business, because we will escalate if you interfere.'\n\nNato has made it clear it has no intention of intervening militarily in Ukraine. But one Russian analyst speculated Putin might fire a nuclear warning shot our way.\n\nPavel Felgenhauer, of the independently minded Novaya Gazeta, said: 'One option for him is to cut gas supplies to Europe, hoping that will make the Europeans climb down. Another option is to explode a nuclear weapon somewhere over the North Sea between Britain and Denmark — and see what happens.'\n\nAnd US intelligence spies fear Russia might have an 'escalate to de-escalate' policy, which means if they should find themselves in conflict with Nato, they would threaten to use low-yield nukes in order to bring a war to an end.\n\n'CONCERNING'\n\nMany wonder whether the former KGB spymaster has become unhinged enough to risk escalating a conflict in this way.\n\nBut one expert believes this could be a ploy.

It was an act of unrivaled industrial and environmental terrorism.\n\nIf Washington had been able to pin the explosions on Russia, as it initially hoped, it would have done so with full vigor. There is nothing Western states would like more than to intensify world fury against Moscow, especially in the context of NATO’s express efforts to 'weaken' Russia through a proxy war waged in Ukraine.\n\nBut, after the claim made the rounds of front pages for a week or two, the story of Russia destroying its own pipelines was quietly shelved. That was partly because it seemed too difficult to maintain a narrative in which Moscow chose to destroy a critical part of its own energy infrastructure.\n\nNot only did the explosions cause Russia great financial harm – the country’s gas and oil revenues regularly financed nearly half of its annual budget – but the blasts removed Moscow’s chief influence over Germany, which had been until then heavily dependent on Russian gas. The initial media story required the Western public to believe that President Vladimir Putin willingly shot himself in the foot, losing his only leverage over European resolve to impose economic sanctions on his country.\n\nBut even more than the complete lack of a Russian motive, Western states knew they would be unable to build a plausible forensic case against Moscow for the Nord Stream blasts.\n\nInstead, with no chance to milk the explosions for propaganda value, official Western interest in explaining what had happened to the Nord Stream pipelines wilted, despite the enormity of the event. That was reflected for months in an almost complete absence of media coverage.\n\nWhen the matter was raised, it was to argue that separate investigations by Sweden, Germany and Denmark were all drawing a blank. Sweden even refused to share any of its findings with Germany and Denmark, arguing that to do so would harm its 'national security.'\n\nNo one, again including the Western media, raised an eyebrow or showed a flicker of interest in what might be really going on behind the scenes. Western states and their compliant corporate media seemed quite ready to settle for the conclusion that this was a mystery cocooned in an enigma.\n\nIsolated and friendless\n\nIt might have stayed that way forever, except that in February, a journalist – one of the most acclaimed investigative reporters of the past half-century – produced an account that finally demystified the explosions.

The San Francisco Fed hosted a conference on climate change in May, in which 27 Fed economists participated.\n\nWith all this effort, one might hope the Fed would produce high-quality research on climate change. But I took a close look at two Fed studies on the subject and found shockingly poor analysis.\n\nThese studies on the effect of temperature on U.S. and world economic growth are cited without a hint of skepticism and widely lavished with media attention. I’ve managed to debunk both.\n\nIn the September issue of Econ Journal Watch, I discredited a paper from the Richmond Fed claiming that warming reduces economic growth in the U.S.\n\nI showed that the paper had serious problems with its statistical reasoning and robustness. My analysis concluded that the data used in the paper showed no meaningful relationship between temperatures and growth.\n\nMore recently I published a critique of a study from the Federal Reserve Board claiming that a year of above-normal temperatures in countries around the world makes economic contraction more likely.\n\nThe original study used sophisticated statistical techniques but failed to report that its primary finding was statistically insignificant. My request to the study’s author for computer code to reproduce the paper’s results went unanswered.\n\nI managed to write the code from scratch and exactly replicate the results, allowing me to run additional tests that the author didn’t report.\n\nThe author’s primary result—that temperature has a bigger effect in bad than in good economic times—turned out to be statistically insignificant. Additional analysis showed that there is no reliable effect of temperature on growth at all.\n\nThere are two main reasons why the Fed study appeared at first to show a statistically significant effect of temperatures on economic growth. First, each country in the sample had equal weight in the analysis.\n\nChina had the same weight as St. Vincent though China’s population is 13,000 times as large. Equal weighting means that some small countries with unusual histories of economic growth greatly influenced the results.\n\nThe paper’s results disappeared when countries like Rwanda and Equatorial Guinea—which had economic catastrophes and bonanzas unrelated to climate change—were omitted.\n\nOmitting similar countries representing less than 1% of the world’s gross domestic product was enough to eliminate the paper’s result. The complicated statistical techniques used in the Fed study magnified the influence of these unusual countries.\n\nThere’s a second reason why the Fed study appears to find that temperature affects growth: Many poor countries have warm climates.\n\nA warm climate doesn’t preclude economic growth, as is demonstrated by Florida, Arizona, Taiwan, Singapore, and several Persian Gulf states. But the average poor country is warmer than the average rich country.\n\nDebate continues as to whether this correlation is random or causal, but the hypothesis of the Fed paper is that year-to-year increases in temperature reduce annual economic growth.\n\nThe paper claims that its method controls for long-term differences in climate, but using simulated data I found that the Fed paper’s method can be fooled into finding an effect that doesn’t exist.\n\nThe only thing to learn from the Fed’s research is that climate propaganda is spreading fast, and when it comes to climate, academic economists are no more deserving of trust than are other supposed scientists and experts.\n\nThe Fed’s time would be better spent on more urgent matters, like improving its botched regulation of the banking system.\n\nh/t Steve B.\n\nRead more at WSJ\n\nJoin our list\n\nSubscribe to our mailing list and get interesting stuff and updates to your email inbox.", "domain": "CC", "labels": {"narrative": ["Criticism of institutions and authorities", "Questioning the measurements and science", "Questioning the measurements and science"], "subnarrative": ["Criticism of national governments", "Methodologies/metrics used are unreliable/faulty", "Scientific community is unreliable"]}}, {"article_id": "EN_UA_102892.txt", "content": "MSM Admits 'Magical Thinking' Guided Its Reporting On Ukraine...

Many Thousands Of Deaths Later\n\nA very short while ago, any US politician or media pundit publicly calling for peace negotiations in Ukraine with Russia's Putin was branded 'pro-Kremlin' and somehow compromised. For example, mainstream media has sought to isolate and cancel thinkers like John Mearsheimer for his realism toward Moscow and the conflict, and urging immediate ceasefire which would require territorial concessions from Kiev. It was only in September that one prominent publication branded him 'the world's most hated thinker.'\n\nBut now, at a moment Ukraine's leadership itself has become more desperate while admitting its forces are facing almost insurmountable odds, the D.C. beltway consensus has clearly and drastically changed, and now it's apparently okay to admit the following...\n\nThe War Street Journal acknowledges that the narratives it’s been pushing for months — of a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive, a possible palace coup in Moscow, a Russian economy in tatters — are 'Magical Thinking.' In other words, their coverage has been a fraud. pic.twitter.com/ZxB25W61Kn— David Sacks (@DavidSacks) November 16, 2023\n\nThe WSJ piece actually calls for a longer-term strategy of confronting Russia, while also admitting that Washington's approach thus far has been based on 'magical thinking'.\n\nOr else we might just call the establishment narrative to this point fraudulent:\n\nWhat Western leaders conspicuously haven’t done is level with their publics about the enduring nature of the threat from an emboldened, revisionist Russia. They have indulged all too often in magical thinking—betting on sanctions, a successful Ukrainian counter-offensive or the transfer of new types of weapons to force the Kremlin to come to the negotiating table. Or they have hoped to see Putin overthrown in a palace coup.\n\nElsewhere in the article, the authors point out that contrary to how the Wagner rebellion was widely presented in Western press, the reality is that whole episode actually strengthened Putin:\n\nAs Russian President Vladimir Putin looks toward the second anniversary of his all-out assault on Ukraine, his self-confidence is hard to miss. A much-anticipated Ukrainian counter-offensive has not achieved the breakthrough that would give Kyiv a strong hand to negotiate. Tumult in the Middle East dominates the headlines, and bipartisan support for Ukraine in the U.S. has been upended by polarization and dysfunction in Congress...\n\nPutin has reason to believe that time is on his side. At the front line, there are no indications that Russia is losing what has become a war of attrition. The Russian economy has been buffeted, but it is not in tatters. Putin’s hold on power was, paradoxically, strengthened following Yevgeny Prigozhin’s failed rebellion in June. Popular support for the war remains solid, and elite backing for Putin has not fractured.\n\nThe tragedy is that so many people from both sides died for a year for nothing— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 16, 2023\n\nOf course, none of this has stopped Zelensky as well as his friends in US Congress from seeking to push through more billions in American taxpayer aid for Ukraine.\n\nOn a global level too, Moscow has made inroads and gotten closer with other well-armed powers who find themselves in Washington's crosshairs...\n\nZelensky has recently complained that 'Russia's goal' to take the global focus away from the Ukraine war is working, particularly against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas conflict and rising tensions in the Middle East. But certainly for now, Ukraine has taken a far backseat among the list of current Biden administration priorities, it seems. Perhaps indeed there's less 'magical thinking' these days.\n\n* * *\n\nUS headlines with 'Ukraine winning' in them, data via Bloomberg:", "domain": "URW", "labels": {"narrative": ["Distrust towards Media", "Speculating war outcomes", "Discrediting the West, Diplomacy", "Discrediting Ukraine", "Praise of Russia", "Discrediting the West, Diplomacy"], "subnarrative": ["Western media is an instrument of propaganda", "Ukrainian army is collapsing", "The West is weak", "Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies", "Praise of Russian military might", "West is tired of Ukraine"]}}, {"article_id": "EN_CC_200013.txt", "content": "Biden Unveils Strict Auto Standards to Speed EV Shift \n\n President Joe Biden's administration announced Wednesday revised pollution standards for cars and trucks meant to accelerate the US auto industry's shift to electric to mitigate climate change.\n\nThe rules set ambitious emission reductions for 2032 but are moderated somewhat compared with preliminary standards unveiled last April. Following carmaker criticism, the final rules give manufacturers greater flexibility and ease the benchmarks in the first three years.\n\nThose shifts were criticized as a sop to corporations from at least one environmental group, even as the final rule won praise from other leading NGOs focused on climate change.\n\nThe final rules -- which were described by administration official as 'the strongest ever' and would likely be undone if Republican Donald Trump defeats Biden in November -- still require a nearly 50 percent drop in fleet-wide emissions in 2032 compared with 2026 through increased sales of electric vehicles (EVs) and low-emission autos.\n\nThe rules, which dovetail with other key Biden programs to build more EV charging stations and manufacturing facilities and incentivize EV sales, establish the environment as a significant point of difference in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nTrump has mocked climate change as a problem and cast the transition to EVs as a job-killer that will benefit China at the expense of American workers.\n\nBiden argues that US auto builders need to take the lead in the expanding EV market.\n\n'I brought together American automakers. I brought together American autoworkers,' said Biden in a statement. 'Together, we've made historic progress.'\n\nAlluding to his target set three years ago that 50 percent of new vehicles in 2030 would be EVs, Biden predicted we'll meet my goal for 2030 and race forward in the years ahead.'\n\n- Industry given more time -\n\nEVs accounted for 7.6 percent in 2023 sales, up from 5.9 percent in 2022, according to Cox Automotive.\n\nThe original proposal had envisioned the EV share surging to as much as 67 percent of new vehicle sales by 2032.\n\nCarmakers, which are midway through sweeping, multi-billion-dollar investments to build more EV capacity, criticized the initial standards as overly-stringent. They cited the limited state of charging capacity in the United States that has dampened consumer demand, as well as difficulties in supply of metals and other raw materials for EV batteries.\n\nFollowing input from the auto industry, organized labor and auto dealerships, Biden administration officials decided to allow manufacturers a 'variety of pathways' to reaching the standard, a senior Biden administration official said Tuesday.\n\nThis path could include a mix of EVs, conventional but more fuel-efficient engines, and plug-in hybrid vehicles, which have seen a rise in demand of late.\n\nBiden administration officials opted to soften year-to-year emissions improvements in the 2027-2030 period, while maintaining the same target in 2032.\n\nModerating the targets in these first three years 'was the right call,' said John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a Washington lobby representing carmakers.\n\n'These adjusted EV targets -– still a stretch goal –- should give the market and supply chains a chance to catch up,' said Bozzella, adding that the extra time will allow more EV charging stations to come on-line.\n\n- Too many 'loopholes'? -\n\nThe final standards set a fleet-wide target of 85 grams of carbon dioxide in 2032, down from 170 in 2027, according to an administration fact sheet.\n\nWednesday's initiative won praise from leading environmental groups including the Sierra Club and NRDC, which said the new rules 'take us in the right direction,' according to a statement from NRDC chief Manish Bapna.\n\nBut Dan Becker, director of the climate transport campaign at the Center for Biological Diversity, slammed the adjusted rules as 'significantly weaker.'\n\n'The EPA caved to pressure from Big Auto, Big Oil and car dealers and riddled the plan with loopholes big enough to drive a Ford F150 through,' Becker said.\n\n'The weaker rule means cars and pickups spew more pollution, oil companies keep socking consumers at the pump, and automakers keep wielding well-practiced delay tactics.'", "domain": "CC", "labels": {"narrative": ["Criticism of climate policies", "Criticism of climate policies"], "subnarrative": ["Climate policies are ineffective", "Climate policies have negative impact on the economy"]}}, {"article_id": "EN_CC_100232.txt", "content": "Offshore wind can be California's next Gold Rush \n\n Letters to the Editor: Offshore wind can be California’s next Gold Rush\n\nTo the editor: Just as the Pacific was critical in transporting miners in the rush for gold and has been key to our state’s and our nation’s epic transoceanic commerce, it can now usher in our next Gold Rush in the form of offshore wind power.\n\nKudos to Michelle Solomon and Taylor McNair for reminding readers that this form of clean, renewable energy blowing along our coast needs only to be harnessed with floating wind turbines and transmitted via infrastructure to our population centers, facilitated by Inflation Reduction Act financial incentives.\n\nThe technology is available, the seed money to pay for the launch of this promising enterprise exists and the need for offshore wind energy could not be greater as the climate crisis ravages much of the world.\n\nGov.

'The war in Ukraine has required', McGahey (right), a barrister representing the government ministries, wrote to Hughes, 'and continues to require work to be undertaken by many of the same individuals and resources who are working on disclosures. Many of those working disclosure are subject matter experts,. While disclosure to the Inquiry is a priority, there have been times when this has had to take second place behind live, ongoing issues of national security.'\n\nMcGahey testifed before Hughes at a two-hour hearing on the Novichok allegations in a London courtroom last Friday, November 11. Follow what was said, and what was meant, in this analysis. An official transcript of the hearing can be read here.\n\nAccording to McGahey, 'approximately 80,000 documents (including emails) have been identified and located as relevant' to the Hughes inquiry. But before any of them can be identified, quoted, or released publicly, McGahey suggested, the government’s Ukraine warfighters will be obliged to down their weapons and pick up censorship tools to prevent the Russians from gaining any advantage.\n\nAs Hughes has announced, referring to the allegations of Novichok poisoning, 'the responsibility for the events in Salisbury [Skripal incident March 4, 2018] and Amesbury [Sturgess incident June 30, 2018] is what is to be decided by this Inquiry. There is, however, at least a prima facie case (denied by those accused) that those responsible were Russian nationals acting in the interests of the Russian state and allegedly under its direction.'\n\nExactly what roles in the Ukraine war the 'subject matter experts' are playing has not been disclosed. The Russian Government has publicly accused the British Government of providing undersea drone and other technology for attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines, Russia’s Black Sea fleet, a plan of attack against the Kakhovka hydroelectric dam, and nuclear weapons design.\n\nMcGahey told Hughes the British Government hasn’t enough money to pay these warfighters to do both the Ukrainian and the Novichok jobs. 'There are stretched resources and budgets across HMG [HHis Majesty’s Government], which are not trivial, and there is very real pressure on government departments and agencies.'\n\nHughes has decided there must be a near-total ban on identifying by name any British official engaged in warmaking against Russia, including intelligence gathering, weapons training, plans and operations.\n\n'The risk of damage to national security here,' he said, ' lies in the risk that hostile actors, whether State or otherwise and, if State, whether Russian or otherwise, might target individuals identified as concerned in the UK reaction to those events, and/or might use access to their names as a means of disrupting UK public functions. I am satisfied, on all the material I have seen, both OPEN and CLOSED, that these are marked real risks to some of those who were involved in the 2018 events, and that Russia in particular has both an interest in such activity and a known capacity to carry it out. For most of these persons therefore, a restriction order is likely to be necessary… [Russia] would have a similar interest in anyone amongst government staff who carried out any sensitive role; an obvious example would be any person concerned in the work of intelligence agencies, or other covert activities, but the risk will not be limited to them. General disclosure of the names of persons subject to these risks would indeed present a hostile actor with a convenient directory of suitable targets and/or a list of sensitive functions which would be of considerable value to a hostile actor accumulating intelligence about UK security and government systems.'\n\nLeave a Reply", "domain": "URW", "labels": {"narrative": ["Blaming the war on others rather than the invader"], "subnarrative": ["The West are the aggressors"]}}, {"article_id": "EN_CC_100007.txt", "content": "ESG in action: Unity Foods partners with The Green Ark to recycle plastic waste \n\n Karachi - Unity Foods continues to showcase a strong commitment to ESG principles through a partnership with The Green Ark (TGA).

The lies to generate fear and justify dystopia are absolutely shocking \n\n A top mosquito expert has blasted Professor Dame Jenny Harries’s claim that climate change will make dengue fever and other mosquito-borne diseases common in the U.K. within 20 years, branding it 'entirely fictional' and 'shameless'.\n\nProfessor Harries, who heads the U.K. Health Security Agency (UKHSA), recently said that rising temperatures will make such diseases common in the U.K. by 2040 because the Asian Tiger Mosquito – which can transmit dengue, chikungunya, zika, yellow fever and other viral diseases – will become established throughout Britain. Dengue will become endemic in London, she claimed.\n\nBut Professor Paul Reiter, retired Professor of Insects and Infectious Diseases at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and a leading expert in mosquito-borne diseases, has ridiculed her claims. He told Net Zero Watch:\n\nThe natural range of the Tiger mosquito, an Asian species, extends from the tropics to regions where mean January temperatures are around –10°C. Northern strains are able to survive because in late summer, as days grow shorter, the eggs they lay are dormant and remain unhatched until spring arrives.\n\nIt is true that since the late 1970s, there has been rapid global spread of the Tiger mosquito to the United States, Latin America, Europe and across Africa, probably mainly via the global trade in used tyres. Professor Reiter says that it is beyond doubt that this has nothing at all to do with temperature.\n\nProfessor Reiter has also lambasted fearmongering about the return of malaria, noting that this was once a major cause of death in many parts of England, even during the Little Ice Age from the 1300s to the 1800s, and its disappearance was, once again, nothing to do with temperature:\n\nShakespeare mentions malaria – 'the ague' – 13 times, so it was clearly once common here.

Fossil fuels provide 80% of our domestic primary energy with an ongoing evolution that has taken about 120 years to build our modern, reliable & affordable domestic energy system. The 'energy transition' will not be accelerated by government mandate or fiat. It will be dictated by the laws of physics and the energy imperatives of cost, energy/power density, scale & sustainability. So, Joe Biden can madate we will 'openly defy gravity by 2050.' That does not mean we can IMPLEMENT it! We’d better get a fully informed, rational and civilzed debate on energy & attendant environmental policy started soon. Otherwise, the average Americans standard of living will continue to head south. Just ask anyone in the EU how the 'Green Dream' is working out.

EU sanctions against Russia, he said, don’t target agricultural products, even though Russia has imposed restrictions on its own food and fertilizer products.\n\n'This is not a battle (of) Russia against the Western part of the world.

Michel avoided direct criticism of China when asked if Beijing has shown any signs of changing its steadfast support of Russia in recent days.\n\nInstead, he said that the G-20 meeting Tuesday and Wednesday was important to convince all nations present 'to put more pressure on Russia.'\n\nAfter a meeting Monday between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Biden said the two leaders discussed Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and 'reaffirmed our shared belief' that the use or even the threat of nuclear weapons is 'totally unacceptable' — a reference to Moscow’s thinly veiled threats to use atomic weapons as its invasion of Ukraine has faltered.\n\nMichel said that Europe must make sure that it creates a different economic and political relationship with China than the one it did with Russia.\n\n'We don't want to make the same mistakes maybe we make with Russia on fossil fuels,' which Europe was very dependent on, 'with China, (where) we don't want to be too dependent for the innovative technology that we need today and that we need more in the future.

Here comes the latest Postwar Gravy Train, laden with massive government spending, lax oversight and other goodies for cunning contractors and economic opportunists seeking to benefit from the near-destruction of Ukraine.\n\nLast week, the State Department announced it intends to seize Russian assets in the United States to help fund rebuilding efforts, though the estimated $300 billion here and in Europe won’t cover the projected price tag of $500 billion. 'What Putin destroyed, Russia should – must – pay to rebuild,' Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.\n\nLike an earlier generation of interventionists, Blinken cites the 'Pottery Barn rule' – You Break It, You Own It – to explain an aggressor’s moral obligation to rebuild. Colin Powell used the same reasoning in the summer of 2002, as a 'caution' to President George W. Bush about the consequences of military action in Iraq. A major difference is the dollars at stake. American and European firms undoubtedly are eager to reconstruct a modern, high-tech country from the ground up.\n\nOur government seeks every opportunity to impose itself, at home and abroad, but has a poor track record for managing projects.\n\nNo-bid contract awards, bribes and billions of missing dollars are the legacy of the Coalition Provisional Authority’s rebuilding work in Iraq, where officials concluded that not enough was accomplished for the amount of funds expended. We learned that when taxpayer money is plentiful, oversight and results will be negligible. Just imagine how generous and hands-off our government might be spending Russia’s money.\n\nNot everyone endorses the act of confiscating Russia’s money, pointing to the principle of reciprocity as a reason to show restraint. 'Stealing' the assets of a foreign country sets a dangerous precedent that could be applied against us. For example, what if China confiscates American assets to fund rebuilding projects in Libya, Iraq or other nations the United States has damaged through war?\n\nThe DC hype-meisters talk about the Great Power Competition of wannabe superpowers; they tell us that China is on the brink of becoming the dominant international force, that Russia is preparing to seize all of Europe. Here, though, the façade falls away—the elites believe the United States has no economic or military peers. When you’re as rich and mighty as America, there’s no fear of reciprocity.\n\nThe elites will do what’s in the immediate best interest of their friends, which include certain corporations and investors who will benefit from the most extensive international project since World War II. For this group, the only morality is a morality of power: Treating other nations the way you want to be treated is a rule for losers and weaker players.\n\nBlinken and the politicians talk about our categorical imperative in Ukraine, how the world relies on America to 'defend democracy' and 'protect the rules-based order.' But their words ring hollow. The cynical truth is that what Russia breaks, America will take—using confiscated money to fund a massive rebuilding project that will be poorly managed, but lucrative for the chosen few involved.\n\nCitizen Soldier believes in life, liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.", "domain": "URW", "labels": {"narrative": ["Discrediting the West, Diplomacy", "Negative Consequences for the West"], "subnarrative": ["The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests", "Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire"]}}, {"article_id": "EN_UA_103941.txt", "content": "Moscow court rejects Evan Gershkovich's appeal, keeping him in jail until at least June 30 \n\n Moscow court rejects Evan Gershkovich’s appeal, keeping him in jail until at least June 30\n\nWall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich will remain jailed on espionage charges until at least late June, after a Moscow court Tuesday rejected his appeal that sought to end his pretrial detention.\n\nThe 32-year-old U.S. citizen was detained in late March 2023 while on a reporting trip and has spent more than a year in jail, with authorities routinely extending his time behind bars and rejecting his appeals.

Established in 2022, the Rumpin Nursery was inaugurated by President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo and is the result of a collaboration between the Environment and Forestry Ministry, the Public Works and Housing Ministry, and APRIL Group, a pulp and paper producer.\n\nAPRIL Group's nursery system in Pangkalan Kerinci, Riau province, inspired the Rumpin Nursery development, which has the capacity of planting approximately 200 million new seedlings per year. The company continues to invest heavily in research and development to increase plantation fiber productivity.\n\nOver the next three years, the Indonesian government plans to build 30 nursery centers, each with an annual production capacity of 10 to 12 million seedlings, which will result in a combined annual production of 360 million seedlings. These seedlings will be used to rehabilitate and restore degraded lands, to be planted on critical land, areas with high landslide potential and upper reaches of river basins (DAS).\n\nThe Rumpin Nursery has successfully grown and planted thousands of native tree species, including Manglid, Sengon, Salam and Sirsak. Since President Jokowi's inauguration last year, the nursery has begun distributing seedlings in a number of locations such as the Ciliwung River. Following the Rumpin Nursery's successful collaboration, the government is currently focusing on developing additional nurseries in other regions, including Danau Toba, Likupang, Mentawir and Bali.\n\nBy replicating and scaling up such models, Indonesia can unlock the potential of nurseries and other nature-based solutions to achieve its ambitious climate goals. This public-private partnership has enabled the Rumpin Nursery to align with the Indonesian government's target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 31.89 percent unconditionally by 2030, as per the updated NDC.\n\nAs part of its efforts to support Indonesia's restoration and forestry goals, the APRIL Group recently earned an appreciation award for its role in the public-private collaboration that established the Rumpin Nursery.\n\nPT Riau Andalan Pulp and Paper, the operating arm of APRIL Group, also received an appreciation award for its work to improve the performance of industrial forest plantations.

The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.\n\nMitigating climate change fosters a cooperative and symbiotic relationship between carbon neutrality, sustainable economic and social development, which is mainly manifested in the following two aspects.\n\nOn the one hand, actions to mitigate climate change and improve the ecological environment can yield direct and indirect economic benefits for socio-economic development. Green and sustainable development can propel the growth of society, from enterprises and businesses to regions and whole nations.\n\n(1) New innovative entrepreneurial opportunities and job positions emerge in response to the need to slow climate change. Innovative entrepreneurship opportunities and employment positions related to carbon neutrality continue to sprout up. For example, as 'carbon' becomes a strategic asset, enterprises have a substantial demand for professionals in carbon accounting and management, resulting in a surge of new job positions. Relevant technologies and market applications also attract a multitude of innovators and entrepreneurs.\n\n(2) The industrial revolution is evident during the process of mitigating climate change, as emerging industries rapidly develop and gradually replace existing ones. For instance, the swift development of the new energy industry and its supporting sectors in recent years has driven the development of the energy storage industry. Additionally, new energy vehicles are gradually replacing traditional fuel ones, leading to changes in the competition landscape and core technologies of the automotive industry. The application of digital and intelligent technology aids the manufacturing industry in achieving the goal of green transition and carbon neutrality, contributing to the high-end transformation of industries and enterprises.\n\n(3) Emerging strategic resources become crucial for enterprises to attract investment and financing. Green initiatives have become a resource for enterprises to attract investment and financing. ESG(environment, social and governance) ratings have become a crucial indicator of whether companies can obtain financing and loans. Carbon trading will also bring companies new revenue sources. Resources like sunlight, water, and wind have evolved into crucial resource endowments for enterprises and countries. Countries and regions abundant in these new and crucial strategic resources will witness shifts in their domestic and international influences.\n\n(4) Demonstration of international competitiveness and industry leadership is linked to the capacity for green innovation and the ability to achieve carbon neutrality. These factors influence the proactiveness and competitiveness of various organizations and countries in global business activities and international business affairs, as well as their international image and market reputation. These capabilities have become essential tools and means to address regional crises. Companies like CATL and BYD have become industry leaders in the global new energy market. Chinese enterprises have contributed to the sustainable environmental and social development of regions including Asia, Africa, and Latin America, facilitating their development and growth in these regions. Meanwhile, the implementation of the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), for example, demonstrates that the ability to reduce carbon emissions will affect enterprises’ import and export costs and international competitiveness.\n\n(5) Improved quality of life for people is a result of environmental protection and improvement, which reduces the adverse impact of harsh environments on health. This, in turn, lowers the demand for medical resources and elevates the overall quality of life, indirectly accelerating socio-economic development.\n\nOn the other hand, socio-economic development further promotes innovative entrepreneurial activities that mitigate climate change. Market-driven technological applications propel the iterative upgrading of green technologies, thus driving overall technological innovation. When people benefit from improved ecological environments, they become more receptive to related technologies and innovations, thereby propelling the development of related technological innovations and entrepreneurial activities. Moreover, when companies benefit from improvements in the ecological environment, they enhance their competitiveness and innovative capacity, boosting their ability to innovate related technologies and undertake entrepreneurial activities.\n\nTherefore, the improvement of the ecological environment through mitigating climate change and the green and sustainable development of businesses are mutually influential and complementary, often leading to their coordinated development.", "domain": "", "labels": {"narrative": ["Other"], "subnarrative": ["Other"]}}, {"article_id": "EN_CC_100146.txt", "content": "Astronaut Catches 'Transient Luminous Event' High Above The Earth \n\n European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Andreas Mogensen has captured a new image of a red sprite, a rare type of electrical discharge rarely seen from Earth.\n\nAs part of the Thor-Davis experiment, Danish astronaut Mogensen heads to the International Space Station's (ISS) Cupola observatory module every Saturday to attempt to photograph storms from above.

But now, the tide has totally turned,' Huasun's chairman Xu Xiaohua said.\n\nIn east China's Anhui Province, where Xu's company is based, the photovoltaic industry has snowballed in the past five years. The number of companies in the business with an annual revenue exceeding 10 billion yuan (about 1.43 billion U.S. dollars) rose to 11 in 2023.\n\nThe boom, which is also recorded beyond Anhui, is underpinned by China's vigorous efforts to expedite a comprehensive transition to green growth as tasks remain daunting.\n\nChina aims to raise the proportion of non-fossil energy consumption to around 25 percent of total energy consumption by 2030, which means the country must make every effort to increase the ratio by one percentage point annually in the next few years.\n\n'The proportion of coal consumption in China's total energy consumption stood at 55.3 percent in 2023, and thus the potential for green and low-carbon energy transition is great,' said Li Zheng, director of the Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development at Tsinghua University.\n\nChina is already revving up the transition to green energy. Official data released this week showed that the installed capacity of solar power came in at approximately 750 million kilowatts in the first eight months of 2024, rocketing 48.8 percent year on year, and the installed capacity of wind power grew 19.9 percent to some 470 million kilowatts.\n\nPan Huimin, deputy head of the National Energy Administration's new and renewable energy department, said the rapid development of the new energy sector in recent years resulted from full market competition, a sound business environment, constant tech innovation and a complete industrial chain.\n\nTo meet the requirement of exports and foster green industrial and supply chains, Chinese enterprises' demand for clean electricity is experiencing 'explosive growth,' Pan said in the latest episode of the China Economic Roundtable, an all-media talk platform hosted by Xinhua.

According to the document, Chinese authorities will use advanced power generation, regulation and control technologies to increase the transmission of clean electricity through the grid.\n\nLocal governments and enterprises should seize opportunities and vigorously exploit wind and solar power in line with local resources and with the capabilities of the grid to absorb the generated electricity, Pan said. ■", "domain": "", "labels": {"narrative": ["Other"], "subnarrative": ["Other"]}}, {"article_id": "EN_CC_100172.txt", "content": "How Do Animals React During a Total Solar Eclipse? \n\n When a total solar eclipse transforms day into night, will tortoises start acting romantic?

They previously detected other strange animal behaviors in 2017 at a South Carolina zoo that was in the path of total darkness.\n\n'To our astonishment, most of the animals did surprising things,' said Adam Hartstone-Rose, a North Carolina State University researcher who led the observations published in the journal Animals.\n\nWhile there are many individual sightings of critters behaving bizarrely during historic eclipses, only in recent years have scientists started to rigorously study the altered behaviors of wild, domestic and zoo animals.\n\nSeven years ago, Galapagos tortoises at the Riverbanks Zoo in Columbia, South Carolina, 'that generally do absolutely nothing all day ... during the peak of the eclipse, they all started breeding,' said Hartstone-Rose. The cause of the behavior is still unclear.\n\nA mated pair of Siamangs, gibbons that usually call to each other in the morning, sang unusual tunes during the afternoon eclipse. A few male giraffes began to gallop in 'apparent anxiety.' The flamingos huddled around their juveniles.\n\nResearchers say that many animals display behaviors connected with an early dusk.\n\nIn April, Hartstone-Rose’s team plans to study similar species in Texas to see if the behaviors they witnessed before in South Carolina point to larger patterns.\n\nSeveral other zoos along the path are also inviting visitors to help track animals, including zoos in Little Rock, Arkansas; Toledo, Ohio; and Indianapolis.\n\nThis year’s full solar eclipse in North America crisscrosses a different route than in 2017 and occurs in a different season, giving researchers and citizen scientists opportunities to observe new habits.\n\n'It’s really high stakes. We have a really short period to observe them and we can’t repeat the experiment,' said Jennifer Tsuruda, a University of Tennessee entomologist who observed honeybee colonies during the 2017 eclipse.\n\nThe honeybees that Tsuruda studied decreased foraging during the eclipse, as they usually would at night, except for those from the hungriest hives.\n\n'During a solar eclipse, there’s a conflict between their internal rhythms and external environment,' said University of Alberta's Olav Rueppell, adding that bees rely on polarized light from the sun to navigate.\n\nNate Bickford, an animal researcher at Oregon Institute of Technology, said that 'solar eclipses actually mimic short, fast-moving storms,' when skies darken and many animals take shelter.\n\nAfter the 2017 eclipse, he analyzed data from tracking devices previously placed on wild species to study habitat use. Flying bald eagles change the speed and direction they’re moving during an eclipse, he said. So do feral horses, 'probably taking cover, responding to the possibility of a storm out on the open plains.'\n\nThe last full US solar eclipse to span coast to coast happened in late summer, in August. The upcoming eclipse in April gives researchers an opportunity to ask new questions including about potential impacts on spring migration.\n\nMost songbird species migrate at night. 'When there are night-like conditions during the eclipse, will birds think it’s time to migrate and take flight?' said Andrew Farnsworth of Cornell University.\n\nHis team plans to test this by analyzing weather radar data – which also detects the presence of flying birds, bats and insects – to see if more birds take wing during the eclipse.\n\nAs for indoor pets, they may react as much to what their owners are doing – whether they’re excited or nonchalant about the eclipse – as to any changes in the sky, said University of Arkansas animal researcher Raffaela Lesch.\n\n'Dogs and cats pay a lot of attention to us, in addition to their internal clocks,' she said.\n\nWhen a total solar eclipse transforms day into night, will tortoises start acting romantic?

'Denmark has faced a lot of challenges in the way and that’s why it wants to share its lessons learnt with Pakistan so that it do not repeat the same mistakes,' he said. The Danish ambassador noted that the Danish companies had adequate technologies to address climate change impacts which can collaborate with their Pakistani counterparts.\n\n'Pakistan is facing double crises; economic crisis coupled with climate change as the 2022 floods inundated one third of the country leaving millions of millions displaced and billions of dollars livestock, infrastructure and ready to harvest crops washed away,' he said. He highlighted that carbon market can be an important tool in developing right and efficient tools to benefit from latest mechanisms to cut carbon emission and address climate change but it should be considered as a financial facility alone. He said the business leaders can take the lead to influence green transition especially in the sectors of steel, fertiliser, and cement where carbon adjustment can be one tool alongwith fuel adjustment and waste management. Soren Lutken, Chief Carbon Market Special UNEP Copenhagen said carbon markets is not the only solution to climate crisis as it was not exactly the idea to reduce but shift the emissions from one place to the other.\n\nHe said Pakistan is the host of the cheaper emissions reduction mechanism whereas it was imperative to break the myth that it has missed the train to address Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). He said the country needed to come up with a clear policy framework to decide its moment to enter the compliance carbon markets.

From Al Gore's mansion to John Kerry's private jets to Leonardo DiCaprio's mega-yacht, these people are all really big on 'Do as we say, not as we do.'\n\nAnd it's worth digging a little deeper into the issues behind the net-zero issue, that being the advocacy for net zero carbon emissions, something that is all but impossible. Why? Because of the things required for the manufacture of electric vehicles (EVs); specifically, their batteries and, even more specifically, the raw materials required to make those batteries.\n\nThis brings us to Indonesia and the environmental havoc that mining for nickel, an essential component of EV batteries, is wreaking on that country.\n\nSwathes of rainforest and coastal communities are being destroyed by a nickel mining boom in Indonesia sparked by the race to transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nAcross the country, a major drive to exploit the country’s abundant natural resources is underway. These photographs capture the sheer scale of the production process.\n\nRows of chimneys, belching smoke and fumes, tower over the schools and houses of what were once rural communities in scenes recalling the work of L.S. Lowry, whose paintings captured life in the industrial districts of North West England in the mid-20th century.\n\nIndonesia is now the world’s largest nickel producer, with 15 per cent of the globe’s lateritic nickel resources – typically low-grade deposits found near the surface.\n\nBut demand is still soaring in tandem with the rise of the electric vehicles (EVs), which depend on it for their batteries.\n\nGuess who is, in large part, funding all this?\n\nBillion dollar Chinese firms anchor the nickel market in Indonesia, but they are often fed cheap ore by hundreds of smaller, mostly locally-owned mines that dot the rainforest. These mines have transformed once-peaceful agrarian villages and communities, providing economic opportunity but a health and environmental crisis looms from pollution.\n\nIn just three years, Indonesia has signed more than a dozen deals worth more than $15 billion for battery materials and electric vehicle production with global manufacturers including Hyundai, LG and Foxconn.\n\nGranted, nickel extraction will probably go on regardless of the EV push, regardless of the net-zero goals of climate scolds, and we should remember that extraction and refining bring jobs to impoverished communities in Indonesia. That's not the point that we should be examining here.\n\nIt's the hypocrisy of the climate scolds ignoring these inescapable consequences of their agenda that's galling.\n\nSee Related: Tax Cuts for the Rich?

In turn, the allegations directed against Russia were used to justify the imposition of sweeping economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.\n\nAccording to President Obama (hours after the tragedy):\n\n'… the downing of MH17 should be 'a wake-up call' to Europe to get serious about confronting Russia over Ukraine after EU leaders have proved reluctant to impose tought sanctions.'

Doing this can help to cut contamination, greenhouse gas emissions and landfill use.\n\nThe Ljubljana Regional Waste Management Centre (RCERO Ljubljana) is the biggest environmental project in Slovenia, and the most modern facility for waste treatment in Europe.\n\nIt is also Slovenia’s biggest cohesion fund environmental project, and a great example of regional cooperation.\n\nEuronews’ Aurora Velez spoke with RCERO Ljubljana’s Founder and Head of Investments and Development, Mjtja Praznik, who created, designed and founded the centre from scratch.\n\nEuronews: How did you come up with the idea for the project?\n\nMjtja Praznik: Some of the activities started in 2000 when Slovenia was joining the EU: we had to adopt a lot of legislative changes in the field of waste management. Up to that time, most of the municipal waste was thrown into landfill. And this, according to new legislation, needed to stop.\n\nSo we thought we needed to treat waste: first, separate it, and then use it for material recycling and energy recovery.\n\nEuronews: What is - according to you- the impact of the project in Slovenia and in Europe?\n\nMjtja Praznik: Slovenia was treating its municipal waste mainly by landfill, losing all the materials and all the energy. By changing the principle, and by introducing this new treatment for waste, the rate of material being recycled has considerably improved.\n\nWe have also replaced some combustibles and energies from the fuel produced in the waste and, last but not least, we have also significantly reduced the amount of waste that is going into landfill. From the new plant, only 2% of the waste goes there: the other 98% is transformed into fuel!\n\nEuronews: How do you feel about having created the project from scratch?\n\nMjtja Praznik: I am very proud of this project. I had the idea 20 years ago and had started researching the technology then.\n\nI am happy that we were able to use our previous experience from landfill, gas extraction and utilisation. All this knowledge has been key to the project.

Sitting atop a hill in the Santa Monica Mountains, the Getty Center, a campus of the Getty Museum and other programs of the Getty Trust, took around 1.3 billion U.S. dollars to build and opened in December 1997. It is well known for its architecture, gardens, and bird's-eye views of Los Angeles.\n\nBuilding on last year's success, where attendees learned about native plant dyes and relished musical performances, this year's event in the museum had a broader scope.\n\nGenerous support for this year's celebration came from the Getty Patron Program, which provides funds for exceptional exhibitions at the museum, reflecting the institution's commitment to diversity and inclusion.\n\n'Los Angeles stands on indigenous land. Recognizing Indigenous Peoples' Day is not just about acknowledgment but about understanding, appreciating, and cherishing the cultures that have been here for thousands of years,' former Los Angeles City Councilman Mitch O'Farrell remarked previously.

'It's not just about the past; it's about the present and future of our art and our communities.'\n\n'I've been attending these celebrations for years, and the shift in narrative is palpable,' Linda M., a Native American LA resident, told Xinhua. 'We appreciate the efforts of California's leaders to ensure that our voices are heard, our histories acknowledged, and our rights secured.'\n\nThe event's broader intent was evident as it also shone light on the pressing challenges faced by Indigenous communities, such as discrimination, disproportionate impacts of climate change, and land rights.\n\nConversations echoed sentiments expressed by leaders like Alannah Hurley, executive director of United Tribes of Bristol Bay, who emphasized that the community is not merely a historical footnote but remains a crucial and vibrant part of the American fabric.\n\nAs the day ended, Mirim S., a student from the University of California, Los Angeles, reflected that 'today was more than a celebration. It was a call to action. We, the younger generation must ensure that the message of diversity and recognition is not confined to a single date but is carried on through our daily lives.'\n\nAs Los Angeles and other cities in California and across the United States continue to celebrate Indigenous Peoples' Day, attendees expressed the hope that it would pave the way for greater understanding, recognition and collaboration in the future.

Ukraine’s leaders say revenues from Russia’s energy exports are financing Moscow’s destructive war on Ukraine and must be ended.\n\nThat won’t be easy to do. The EU’s 27 nations get around 40% of their natural gas from Russia and around 25% of their oil. Natural gas would be the most difficult do without, energy analysts say, since most of it comes by pipeline from Russia and supplies of liquefied gas, which can be ordered by ship, are limited amid strong demand worldwide.\n\nGermany, a major manufacturing hub and an importer of Russian gas, has so far resisted an immediate shut-off and said it plans to instead phase out Russian oil by the end of the year and most Russian gas imports by mid-2024. The EU’s executive commission has outlined steps to cut the consumption of Russian gas by two-thirds by year’s end through using more pipeline gas from Norway and Azerbaijan, importing more liqueifed gas, accelerating the deployment of wind and solar projects and intensifying conservation efforts.\n\nGerman Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck said in an interview with the Funke media group that 'an immediate gas embargo would endanger social peace in Germany.'\n\nDespite widespread economic sanctions against Russian banks and individuals, the EU continues to send around $850 million a day to Russia for oil and gas, even as EU governments condemn the war in Ukraine. Gas-intensive companies include producers of glass, metals, ceramics and chemicals.
